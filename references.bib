              reduction reactions (ORR) can generally be enhanced by
              constructing high-index exposed facets (HIFs). However, the
              synthesis of Pt alloyed high-index skins on 1D non-Pt surfaces to
              further improve Pt utilization and stability remains a
              fundamental challenge for practical nanocrystals. In this work,
              Pd nanowires (NWs) are selected as a rational medium to
              facilitate the epitaxial growth of Pt and Ni. Based on the
              different nucleation and growth habits of Pt and Ni, a continuous
              PtNi alloy skin bounded with HIFs spiraled on a Pd core can be
              obtained. Here, the as-prepared helical Pd@PtNi NWs possess high
              HIF densities, low Pt contents, and optimized oxygen adsorption
              energies, demonstrating an enhanced ORR mass activity of 1.75 A
              mgPt-1 and a specific activity of 3.18 mA cm-2 , which are 10
              times and 12 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalysts,

              catalyst to be highly stable after 30 000 potential sweeping

              value is a useful indicator providing the hydrophobic

              was that the reactions between 2,6-DMHQ and iron oxide
              nanoparticles generated substantial amounts of ·OH under certain
              conditions via parallel reductive dissolution and catalytic
              oxidation reactions. The presence of O2 was essential for the
              catalytic oxidation of 2,6-DMHQ and the generation of H2O2.
              Moreover, the higher reduction potential of ferrihydrite relative
              to that of goethite made the former species more susceptible to
              reductive dissolution, which favored the production of ·OH. The
              results highlighted the effects of surface charge and ligand
              competition on the 2,6-DMHQ oxidation processes and showed that
              the co-adsorption of anions can promote the generation of ·OH.",

              SOFCs exhibit ∼ 20 times difference in polarization resistance
              and catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),
              which are synthesized by pulsed laser deposition under different
              temperatures. The thin-films grown at 650 °C possess consistent
              crystal orientation, while those grown at 500 °C have different
              crystal orientations between NSC113 and NSC214 layers. As
              observed, they show ∼102 times and ∼101 times, respectively,
              higher ORR performance than a single-phase NSC113 thin-film
              electrode, as characterized by constructing full cell operated at
              intermediate-temperature. The origin of such performance
              differences is analyzed on the basis of crystal orientation by
              HRXRD, HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, TOF-SIMS, and DFT calculation, and the
              results indicate that the increased crystal orientations can
              significantly weaken the positive effects of heterointerface.
              This observation is attributed to the formation of excessive
              grain boundaries, which leads to increased formation energy of
              oxygen vacancy and limited oxygen transportation. These results
              highlight that the precise control of crystal orientation can
              make full use of heterostructure to enhance the ORR performance

               that (i) hydrated crystal phases are formed when MAPI is exposed
               to water vapor at room temperature and (ii) these phase changes
               are fully reversed when the material is subsequently dried. The
               reversible formation of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O followed by
               (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O (upon long exposure times) was observed using
               time-resolved XRD and ellipsometry of thin films prepared using
               ``solvent engineering'', single crystals, and state-of-the-art
               solar cells. In contrast to water vapor, the presence of liquid
               water results in the irreversible decomposition of MAPI to form
               PbI2. MAPI changes from dark brown to transparent on hydration;
               the precise optical constants of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O formed on single
               crystals were determined, with a bandgap at 3.1 eV. Using the
               single-crystal optical constants and thin-film ellipsometry
               measurements, the time-dependent changes to MAPI films exposed
               to moisture were modeled. The results suggest that the
               monohydrate phase forms independent of the depth in the film,
               suggesting rapid transport of water molecules along grain
               boundaries. Vapor-phase hydration of an unencapsulated solar
               cell (initially Jsc $\approx$ 19 mA cm--2 and Voc $\approx$ 1.05
               V at 1 sun) resulted in more than a 90\% drop in short-circuit
               photocurrent and ∼200 mV loss in open-circuit potential;
               however, these losses were fully reversed after the device was
               exposed to dry nitrogen for 6 h. Hysteresis in the
               current--voltage characteristics was significantly increased
               after this dehydration, which may be related to changes in the
               defect density and morphology of MAPI following
               recrystallization from the hydrate. Based on our observations,
               we suggest that irreversible decomposition of MAPI in the
               presence of water vapor only occurs significantly once a grain
               has been fully converted to the monohydrate phase.",

              comprehensive kinetic examination of a model carboxylate
              O-arylation, comparing a state-of-the-art homogeneous
              photocatalyst (Ir(ppy)3) with a competitive heterogeneous
              photocatalyst (graphitic carbon nitride). Experimental conditions
              were adjusted such that the nickel catalytic cycle is saturated
              with excited photocatalyst. This approach was designed to remove
              the role of the photocatalyst, by which only the intrinsic
              behaviors of the nickel catalytic cycles are observed. The two
              reactions did not display identical kinetics. Ir(ppy)3
              deactivates the nickel catalytic cycle and creates more
              dehalogenated side product. Kinetic data for the reaction using
              Ir(ppy)3 supports a turnover-limiting reductive elimination.
              Graphitic carbon nitride gave higher selectivity, even at high
              photocatalyst-to-nickel ratios. The heterogeneous reaction also
              showed a rate dependence on aryl halide, indicating that
              oxidative addition plays a role in rate determination. The

              most challenging tasks for solar-energy utilization. Over the
              past 30 years, the search for such materials has focused mainly
              on metal-ion substitution as in In(1-x)Ni(x)TaO(4) and (V-,Fe- or
              Mn-)TiO(2) (refs 7,8), non-metal-ion substitution as in
              TiO(2-x)N(x) and Sm(2)Ti(2)O(5)S(2) (refs 9,10) or solid-solution
              fabrication as in (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)) and

              oxidize water as well as decompose organic contaminants in

               The composite photocatalysts exhibited higher activities than

               (the rate constant kapp = 1.75 min--1) was observed over the
               Ag3PO4/In(OH)3 with a molar ratio of 1.65:1.00. The further
               mechanism study and material characterizations indicated that
               the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the
               surface-electric property of the composite photocatalyst.
               Moreover, the surface-electric property could be continually

              oxidative etching conditions leading to the formation of a

              Silver nanowires with independently controlled lengths and
              diameters were synthesized with a gram-scale polyol synthesis by
              controlling the reaction temperature and time. Characterization
              of films composed of nanowires of different lengths but the same
              diameter enabled the quantification of the effect of length on
              the conductance and transmittance of silver nanowire films.
              Finite-difference time-domain calculations were used to determine
              the effect of nanowire diameter, overlap, and hole size on the
              transmittance of a nanowire network. For individual nanowires
              with diameters greater than 50 nm, increasing diameter increases
              the electrical conductance to optical extinction ratio, but the
              opposite is true for nanowires with diameters less than this
              size. Calculations and experimental data show that for a random
              network of nanowires, decreasing nanowire diameter increases the
              number density of nanowires at a given transmittance, leading to
              improved connectivity and conductivity at high transmittance

              porosity-related weakening. Here, we report, synthetic molecular
              auxeticity for a non-porous liquid crystal elastomer. For strains
              above ~0.8 applied perpendicular to the liquid crystal director,
              the liquid crystal elastomer becomes auxetic with the maximum
              negative Poisson's ratio measured to date being -0.74 $\pm$ 0.03
              - larger than most values seen in naturally occurring molecular
              auxetics. The emergence of auxeticity coincides with the liquid
              crystal elastomer backbone adopting a negative order parameter,
              QB = -0.41 $\pm$ 0.01 - further implying negative liquid crystal
              ordering. The reported behaviours consistently agree with
              theoretical predictions from Warner and Terentjev liquid crystal
              elastomer theory. Our results open the door for the design of
              synthetic molecular auxetics.",

  author   = "Wehrens-Dijksma, M and Notten, P H L",
  abstract = "The use of the Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM)
              to study the proton intercalation performance of thin film
              Ni(OH)2 layers, nowadays widely used as cathode electrode
              material in rechargeable Ni(OH)2-based battery systems such as
              NiMH and NiCd, is reviewed. In addition, the impact of
              incorporating foreign metals in these layers on the
              electrochemical performance will be highlighted. Using EQCM much
              information can be obtained, as both the electrochemical response
              and accompanying mass changes can be measured simultaneously.
              EQCM was extensively used to investigate the effect of the
              conditions on the formation of Ni(OH)2 thin layers, the
              $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ modification changes and the details of the
              redox mechanism. The proposed redox mechanisms differ in whether
              H+ or OH− is transferred, the reactants and/or products are
              hydrated and cations from the solution take part in the reaction.
              By incorporation of other metals in the structure, the
              characteristics of thin Ni(OH)2 layers can be tuned. This affects
              the oxidation and reduction potential, the reversibility, the
              stability of the structure and the oxygen evolution side
              reaction. Co2+ and Fe2+ were shown to replace Ni-sites in the
              hydrous oxide lattice, thereby forming very dense structures with
              higher stability. However, structural changes still occur in most
              cases. Due to this inhomogeneity, the layers are usually a
              combination of different structures, depending on the
              distribution of the incorporated metal(s). Suppression of the
              oxygen evolution reaction is reported for Co, Pb, Pd, Zn and Mn.
              The effects of Co and Mn are shown to depend on the incorporated
              amount. Co shifts the standard redox potential for the oxygen
              evolution reaction towards more cathodic potentials and decreases
              the oxygen overpotential significantly. Light-weight rare-earth
              elements also catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction.",

               be used as artificial muscles for microrobotics because their
               actuation can be induced wirelessly, which reduces the
               complexity of the device or system. Here, we report a material
               system, nickel hydroxide-oxyhydroxide, that could actuate
               because of a volume change stimulated by illumination of visible
               light of low intensities. The actuating material here exhibited
               a turbostratic crystal structure capable of intercalating water,
               and we show that the intercalated water can be rapidly and
               reversibly desorbed into the environment under visible light of
               low intensities, resulting in fast actuation driven wirelessly
               by light. By electroplating the actuating material on passive
               substrates, we have fabricated film actuators capable of
               undergoing reversible bending and curling with an intrinsic
               actuating stress of 5 to 65 megapascals at response rates in the
               order of tens to hundreds of degrees per second depending on the

              environment at low voltages is demonstrated and studied for the
              first time. Specifically, sub-micron layers of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH

              ∼0.1\% in an alkaline solution under a low voltage of only ∼0.4V,
              causing a 5-mm long bi-layer actuator to bend by ∼3.5mm at its
              end, giving a large device strain of ∼70\%. The actuation
              mechanism is found to be due to a redox reaction in the

              For weaker screening, the wider space charge layer implies a

               because of the possible flexible substitution of numerous ions
               in its system. These compounds have a broad range of
               applications due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties
               in solar cells, photodetectors, lasers, and light-emitting
               diodes (LEDs). Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are highly
               tolerant to defects, unlike metal chalcogenides, and do not
               require surface passivation to retain high quantum yields.
               Interestingly, the defect structures and trap states in
               perovskites are often found only in their conduction and/or
               valence bands and not in the mid-states of the bandgap. Such
               characteristics essentially boost their properties and largely
               favor their sensing applications. Perovskites have thus been
               attempted by numerous groups to address the serious concern of
               heavy metal ions, biomolecules, and gas molecule detection with
               high selectivity and sensitivity limits. In this context, the

               evaluate the performance of DEAs. The DEA tends to be a compact

               characterize the mechanical behavior. The result shows that the
               output force induced by the DEA can be improved by 76.90\% under
               a certain applied voltage and initial magnet distance. Moreover,

              difference FTIR spectra of RC films at two hydration levels
              (relative humidity r=76\% and r=11\%). Dehydration reduced the

              water molecules hydrogen bonded to the RC, previously proposed to
              stabilize the charge separation by dielectric screening [Iwata et

              the hydration shell (r=11\%), including contributions from modes
              of P (9-keto groups), and from NH or OH stretching modes of amino

               Maxwell coil for the microrobot 5 DOF locomotion in 3D space is

               oscillating magnetic field in a three-dimensional space by

               are introduced in to a hydrothermal reactor in a medium of zinc
               acetate and HMTA to realize the nanostructures. The process
               results in the formation of ZnO nanowires with dimensions that
               are strongly dependent on the surface microstructure of the ZnO
               films. The role of temperature (90--180 °C) and duration (10 min
               to 10 h) of hydrothermal processing is investigated in detail.
               It is demonstrated that low temperature and short duration are
               ideal for producing nanowires with diameter < 100 nm, while
               longer durations and higher temperatures lead to large diameter
               and long length nanowires. Interestingly, all wires converge to
               a hexagonal shape with increase in duration or temperature. The
               lowest diameter of the vertically aligned nanowires is 50 nm and
               length upto 10 $\mu$m is achieved. Optical band gap of the
               homo-structures is of the order of 3.4--3.5 eV. Raman and
               photoluminescence spectra indicate the presence of defects in

               photoluminescence peak centred around 550 nm. The nanowires

               well as the defect related peak. However, the intensity of the
               defect peak decreases with increase in length of the nanowires
               indicating that the photoluminescence of the homo-structures can
               be tuned by changing the surface microstructure of the films and

               the DIPAB continuous film, which is essential to explore its
               application potential, is challenging because its
               crystallization kinetics favors island-like microcrystalline

               organic ferroelectric DIPAB film on a single crystalline Si(100)
               substrate is demonstrated by a thermal evaporation process.
               Structural and optical studies reveal that the film is c-axis
               oriented with an optical bandgap of 3.52 eV. The topographic
               image displays well-connected grain-like surface morphology with
               ∼2 nm roughness. The ferroelectric domain studies illustrate the
               in-plane orientation of the domains, which is in accordance with
               c-axis oriented film where polarization is along the in-plane

               hysteresis and butterfly characteristics, respectively and
               thereby endorse the ferroelectric nature of the film.
               Importantly, it is demonstrated that the DIPAB film exhibits
               remarkable self-powered UV-Vis photodetector characteristics

              transition is unexplored. Here, we use molecular dynamics
              simulations with a TIP4P/2005 water model to study the
              translational and rotational relaxation dynamics of interfacial
              water on graphene surfaces. The purpose of this study is to
              investigate the influence of both the surface chemistry and the
              extent of hydration on the rotational transitions of interfacial
              water on graphene oxide (GO) surfaces in the deeply supercooled
              region. We have considered three graphene-based surfaces: a GO
              surface with equal proportions of oxidized and pristine graphene
              regions in a striped topology, a fully oxidized surface and a
              pristine graphene surface. The dipole relaxation time of
              interfacial water (high hydration) shows a strong-to-strong
              transition, strong nature, and strong-to-strong transition on
              these surfaces, respectively, in the temperature range of 210-298
              K. In contrast, bulk water shows a fragile-to-strong rotational
              transition upon supercooling. In all these cases at high
              hydration, interfacial water co-exists with a thick water film
              with bulk-like properties. To investigate the influence of bulk
              water on dynamical transitions, we simulated a low hydration
              regime where only bound water (surface water) is present on the
              GO surfaces and found that the rotational relaxation of surface
              water on both the GO and fully oxidized surfaces shows a single
              Arrhenius temperature dependence. Bulk water is found to have a
              greater influence on the rotational relaxation in the presence of
              a hydrophobic surface and the dipole angular distributions show
              distinct differences on the surfaces upon supercooling. Our
              results indicate that not only does the local extent of surface
              hydrophilicity play a role in determining the energy landscape
              explored by the water molecules upon supercooling, but the
              presence of bulk water also modulates the dynamic transition.",

               successfully fabricated for the first time. The piezoresistive

               nanoimprinting process based on an intermediate polymer
               substrate (IPS) replica mold. It showed a superior sensitivity
               (71.37 kPa−1) and a high optical transmittance (77.7\% at 550
               nm) due to the effective quantum tunneling effect even at small
               concentrations of conductive SSNP filler (6 mg mL−1). The
               high-performance characteristics of the piezoresistive pressure
               sensor are attributed to the geometric effects of the microdome
               structure, especially the stress concentration at small contact
               spots and the deformation of the contact area. The
               piezoresistive pressure sensor with microdome arrays also
               exhibited a fast response/relaxation time (30 ms), ultra-low

              is found to interact weakly with $\beta$-Ni(OH)2(001), but

              $\beta$-NiOOH(001) show a high degree of ordering correlated with
              a large surface polarization effect. In comparison, interfacial
              water at $\beta$-Ni(OH)2(001) exhibits enhanced disorder and
              higher mobility. The weak interaction of water with
              $\beta$-Ni(OH)2(001) is consistent with the small dipole moment

               during the oxidation of evaporated nickel films and the
               reduction of nickel oxide with hydrogen. The measurements
               included changes in the spectral sensitivity of surfaces
               prepared under varied conditions, and in the photoelectric yield
               (at constant photon energy) during the admission of gas.
               Admission of oxygen to nickel films at 20⚬C resulted in several
               distinct effects. Lightly oxidized films ( 1000
               $^\overset\circ\{A\}$ thick) has been examined, and the
               interaction of hydrogen with these films was studied in detail.
               Changes in photoelectric yield show that there is some small
               degree of chemisorption at 20⚬C, and it is postulated that this
               represents formation of H+ 2 which either penetrates the nickel

              that the non-modified Ni nanowires possess a poor electrochemical

               cyclic voltammograms of the fabricated sensor exhibited an
               increased anodic peak current associated with a decrease in the

               Accordingly, a mechanism involving generation of Ni3+ active
               sites and their subsequent consumption by the drug was proposed.
               Moreover, the corresponding rate law under the control of charge

              hydroxide/oxyhydroxide (Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) and cobalt

              are inexpensive to fabricate by fast electrodeposition. However,
              as their actuation is due to the volume change accompanying the
              light-induced desorption of intercalated water in their
              turbostratic structures, their actuation reduces over time as
              crystallization takes place slowly, which lowers the amount of

               water electrolyte due to a voltage applied across the interface,
               as a result of capacitive charging of the double layer in the
               contacting electrolyte as well as redox reaction of the Ni
               surface. The calculated surface stress is then used as input in
               a meso-scale finite-element (FE) model to compute the actuating
               stress set up in a single hexagonal unit cell of the Ni
               nanohoneycomb structure. The single-unit actuating stress is
               eventually used in a continuum FE model at a larger scale, to
               calculate the bending of an entire bilayered cantilever which
               replicates experimental conditions. The actuation deflection of
               the bilayered nanohoneycomb nickel is predicted to be 41.4
               $\mu$m at 0.43 V vs the point of zero charge (PZC), which
               corresponds to ∼0.48 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and
               this is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of
               45--62 $\mu$m at a similar voltage vs SCE. This is the first
               successful attempt to simulate the electrochemical actuation of
               a real-sized, nano-porous metallic structure in an electrolytic
               environment. \copyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

  abstract = "The structure and properties of $\alpha$-Ni(OH)2 containing water
              and nitrate have been investigated computationally. The
              adsorption of water molecules on the Ni(OH)2 surface is also
              investigated to provide insight into the nature of the
              water-Ni(OH)2 interactions. The spectroscopic and dynamical
              behaviour of the intercalated species has been characterized and
              used to explain experimental findings reported for this material.
              The results presented here indicate that the water molecules
              interact non-covalently with Ni(OH)2, with a binding energy that
              is comparable in magnitude with that of the water dimer hydrogen
              bond. The presence of the intercalated species increases the
              distance between the Ni(OH)2 layers such that the interlayer
              interactions are negligible. The weakening of the interlayer
              interactions facilitates the horizontal displacement of the
              layers relative to one another, providing a possible origin for
              stacking faults observed in $\alpha$-Ni(OH)2. Comparison of the
              vibrational frequencies calculated here with the experimental
              spectra confirms that $\alpha$-Ni(OH)2 containing only water
              molecules can be synthesized. The structures of the water
              molecules intercalated in $\alpha$-Ni(OH)2 were found to be
              analogous to those absorbed in $\gamma$-NiOOH, while the
              water-layer interactions are stronger in $\gamma$-NiOOH. The
              results presented here characterize the structure and
              interactions of water intercalated in nickel hydroxides and also
              provide insights into the effects of intercalated water on the

              of the NiOOH catalyst under the working conditions used for OER.
              We demonstrate the important effect of the electrolyte pH on the
              degree of surface deprotonation of NiOOH, which crucially affects
              its OER activity. Our results show that the deprotonation of
              NiOOH produces negatively charged (or proton-deficient) surface
              species, which are responsible for the enhanced OER activity of
              NiOOH in highly alkaline pH. Moreover, we provide spectroscopic
              evidence obtained in an 18O-labeled electrolyte that allows us to
              assign this surface species to a superoxo-type species (Ni-OO-).
              Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the OER on NiOOH which is
              consistent with the observed pH-sensitivity, and that also
              explains why NiOOH is not a suitable catalyst for applications in
              neutral or moderately alkaline pH (in the range 7-11), apart from
              the lower stability of the catalyst under these conditions.",

               batteries, has been the subject of much recent interest due to
               its efficacy as an oxygen evolution catalyst. Despite extensive
               study over more than a century, however, many outstanding
               questions remain surrounding both the structure and the activity
               of NiOx. Further compounding this ambiguity is the recent
               finding that much of the previous experimental work on NiOx may
               have been influenced by incidental doping. Here, we report a
               computational study of the two simplest members of the NiOx
               family: $\beta$-Ni(OH)2 and $\beta$-NiOOH. Using DFT+U
               calculations, we first identify a $\beta$-NiOOH structure with a
               staggered arrangement of intercalated protons that is more
               consistent with experimental crystal structures of $\beta$-NiOOH
               than previously proposed geometries. Next, by conducting a
               thorough study of various initial spin configurations of this
               $\beta$-NiOOH structure, we found that a low-spin d7 Ni3+
               configuration is always favored, which suggests a Jahn--Teller
               distortion, rather than disproportionation, explains the
               different Ni--O bond distances found in experiment. G0W0
               calculations performed on $\beta$-Ni(OH)2 and $\beta$-NiOOH
               reveal electronic structures consistent with previous
               experimental results. Lastly, calculations of various low-index
               surface energies of both $\beta$-Ni(OH)2 and $\beta$-NiOOH
               demonstrate that the (001) surface is the most thermodynamically

               methanogenic bacteria and in other biological systems has
               focused attention on the redox chemistry of nickel. This chapter
               discusses the redox chemistry of nickel basing on the most
               recent advances. This chapter presents a discussion on the
               structural and electronic requirements of the four oxidation
               states---I, II, III, and IV--- and of the primary physical
               techniques and probes used. A description of the most commonly
               used ligand types follows, together with an indication of recent
               trends in the area. Discussions conclude with a review of the
               recent mechanistic chemistry of the oxidation states in turn.
               The nickel(II) ion has a d8 electronic configuration and, with
               weak-field ligands such as H2O, it forms a six-coordinate ion
               with approximately octahedral symmetry and a paramagnetic (two
               unpaired electrons) 3A2 ground state. The X-ray crystal
               structures of a variety of high- and low-oxidation-state nickel
               complexes are now known. The technique most widely applied as a
               structural probe in the chemistry of both nickel(III) and
               nickel(I) is electron paramagnetic resonance. The mechanistic
               chemistry of nickel(IV) is dominated by substitution inert

               many different designs and applications have been investigated.
               The electrothermal actuation method offers several advantages
               when compared with the other types of actuation approaches based
               on electrostatic and piezoelectric principles. The

              $\alpha$- and $\beta$(II)-nickel hydroxides during ageing tests

              ageing tests, the $\beta$(II)-type crystallites grow via an
              Oswald ripening process, while the $\alpha$-phase is transformed
              into a $\beta$(II)-phase via a dissolution, nucleation and growth
              process. For both materials, zinc is partially lost during the
              ageing tests. Soft oxidation of the $\beta$(II)-phase leads to a
              $\beta$(III)-type one; subsequent reduction yields a
              $\beta$(II)-phase very similar to the starting material but
              exhibiting a mosa{\i}c texture. Strong oxidation of the
              $\beta$(II)-phase leads to a well-crystallised
              $\gamma$-oxyhydroxide which is reduced to an $\alpha$-phase with
              an interslab distance of 7.3 {\AA}. Strong oxidation of the
              $\alpha$-phase leads to a poorly crystallised interstratified
              $\gamma$-type phase containing carbonate ions together with a
              small amount of the starting $\alpha$-phase. Subsequent reduction
              yields an $\alpha$-phase with a structure very similar to that of
              the starting material (interslab distance close to 8.4 {\AA}).
              Repeated strong oxidation and reduction reactions of the
              $\alpha$-phase progressively lead to a $\beta$(II)-phase via the
              formation of interstratified materials. A SEM study shows that
              all redox reactions occur in the solid state. A partial loss of
              zinc is evidenced during strong oxidation of $\beta$(II)- and
              $\alpha$-phases. Since a large amount of zinc is lost during
              strong oxidation reactions, octahedral vacancies must remain
              within the slabs of the resulting $\beta$-phase.",

               excitation at roughened gold. These signals, identified with
               Ni‐OH and Ni‐O vibrations from deuterium isotope data, were
               diagnosed as arising from surface‐enhanced Raman scattering

              hydroxide/sulfides nanosheet composed of Ni(OH)2, Ni3S2 and NixS6
              was loaded on CdS nanospheres by a simple chemical deposition
              route. The composition of nickel hydroxide/sulfides was
              determined clearly through an overall analysis using X-ray
              diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy. Mott-Schottky, electrochemical
              impedance, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence
              spectroscopy were used to investigate the charge transfer process
              in CdS and Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2/NixS6-CdS. The results confirm that a
              synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2/NixS6 on CdS has occurred
              under light irradiation, where the Ni(OH)2 and nickel sulfides
              act as hole storage and surface reaction sites, respectively, to
              promote the charge transfer on CdS. The improved charge transfer

              reaction sites in Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2/NixS6-CdS finally result in a
              dramatically improved photocatalytic performance. The
              photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2/NixS6-CdS is
              ca. 46 times higher than that of CdS, and the photocatalytic

              NiCo-LDH/P-CdS hybrid photocatalysts are fabricated by combining
              strategies of P-doping and in-situ loading of NiCo-LDH. P-doping
              creates a mid-gap at the bottom of the conduction band of CdS,
              which facilitates to prolong the life-time of the photo-induced
              electrons. Subsequently, the in-situ loading of NiCo-LDH is able
              to form heterojunctions between NiCo-LDH and P-CdS that not only
              promote the separation efficiency of carriers, but also
              effectively reduce the light corrosion phenomenon commonly
              observed in CdS. The as-prepared 2 mol\% NiCo-LDH/40 wt\% P-CdS

              8.665 mmol·h−1 g−1, which is 45 times higher than pure CdS. The

               way of fabricating mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanocomposite
               materials composed of metal oxide and spinel phases. A detailed
               understanding of the mechanism of the transformation of the LDH
               precursor to the MMO should allow the properties of the
               resulting MMO nanocomposites to be tailored to specific
               applications. Here we report a systematic investigation of the
               structure, composition, and morphology evolution from ZnAl-LDHs
               to ZnO-based MMO nanocomposites composed of ZnO and ZnAl2O4 on
               calcination at different temperatures. The nucleation and
               oriented growth of ZnO crystallites and the formation of ZnAl2O4
               were monitored by high resolution transmission electron
               microscopy (HRTEM) combined with selected-area electron
               diffraction (SAED), in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state
               27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (27Al MAS
               NMR), and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses
               (TG−DTA). The layered structure of the LDH precursor was
               maintained as the temperature was increased from room
               temperature to 180 °C. Upon further heating from 200 to 400 °C,
               ZnO nuclei doped with Al3+ were first formed as an amorphous
               phase and then underwent oriented growth along the ⟨101̅0⟩
               direction. The high aspect ratio of the LDH platelets is
               responsible for the oriented growth of the resulting ZnO
               crystallites. On further increasing the calcination temperature,
               Zn2+ ions were continuously released from the amorphous phase
               resulting in the formation of crystalline ZnO nanoparticles
               doped with Al3+, which are homogeneously dispersed throughout
               the amorphous phase. When the calcination temperature reached
               500 °C, Al3+ ions were released from the ZnO-like structure
               resulting in the formation of ZnAl2O4 spinel and the
               crystallinity of the spinel increased gradually with increasing
               temperature. Sintering of ZnO and ZnAl2O4, with concomitant loss
               of the platelet-like morphology, occurred below 800 °C.
               UV−visible spectroscopy showed that the ZnO/ZnAl2O4
               nanocomposite prepared by calcination of the ZnAl-LDH precursor
               at 800 °C has superior UV-blocking properties to both commercial
               ZnO and a physical mixture of ZnO and ZnAl2O4.",

               material exhibited significant absorption in the visible range

               material were obtained from the BET isotherm for N2 adsorption
               at 77 K. Zeta potential measurements were used to characterize
               the electrical properties of the surface while XPS revealed

               properties of the material were explained on the basis of the
               narrow band gap, the high surface area and the presence of

               due to the electrostatic attractions between the dye cations and
               the negative charges on the Ni/Ti LDH surface. The catalytic
               activity was found to be higher than the common commercial
               catalysts like ZnO, ZnS, NiO, TiO2 and Degussa P25. The

              desorption, $\xi$-potential, FT-IR and TG techniques. The

               photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of the as-prepared
               samples in methanol aqueous solution was investigated. The
               results showed that the photocatalytic H2-production activity of
               TiO2 was significantly enhanced by loading Ni(OH)2 clusters. The
               optimal Ni(OH)2 loading content was found to be 0.23 mol \%,
               giving a H2-production rate of 3056 $\mu$mol h−1 g−1 with
               quantum efficiency (QE) of 12.4\%, exceeding that on pure TiO2
               by more than 223 times. This high photocatalytic H2-production
               activity is due to the deposition of Ni(OH)2 clusters on the
               surface of TiO2. The enhanced mechanism is because the potential
               of Ni2+/Ni (Ni2+ + 2e− = Ni, Eo = −0.23 V) is slightly lower
               than conduction band (CB) (−0.26 V) of anatase TiO2, meanwhile
               higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (2H+ + 2e− = H2, Eo
               = −0.00 V), which favors the electron transfer from CB of TiO2
               to Ni(OH)2 and the reduction of partial Ni2+ to Ni0. The
               function of Ni0 is to help the charge separation and to act as
               cocatalyst for water reduction, thus enhancing the

  abstract = "Epidemiological research has linked exposure to atmospheric
              particulate matter (PM) to several adverse health effects,
              including cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality.
              Despite these links, the mechanisms by which PM causes adverse
              health effects are poorly understood. The generation of hydroxyl
              radical (.OH) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) through
              transition metal-mediated pathways is one of the main hypotheses
              for PM toxicity. In order to better understand the ability of
              particulate transition metals to produce ROS, we have quantified
              the amounts of .OH produced from dissolved iron and copper in a
              cell-free, surrogate lung fluid (SLF). We also examined how two
              important biological molecules, citrate and ascorbate, affect the
              generation of .OH by these metals. We have found that Fe(II) and
              Fe(III) produce little .OH in the absence of ascorbate and
              citrate, but that they efficiently make .OH in the presence of
              ascorbate and this is further enhanced when citrate is also
              added. In the presence of ascorbate, with or without citrate, the
              oxidation state of iron makes little difference on the amount of
              .OH formed after 24 hours. In the case of Cu(II), the production
              of .OH is greatly enhanced in the presence of ascorbate, but is
              inhibited by the addition of citrate. The mechanism for this
              effect is unclear, but appears to involve formation of a
              citrate-copper complex that is apparently less reactive than
              free, aquated copper in either the generation of HOOH or in the
              Fenton-like reaction of copper with HOOH to make .OH. By
              quantifying the amount of .OH that Fe and Cu can produce in
              surrogate lung fluid, we have provided a first step into being
              able to predict the amounts of .OH that can be produced in the
              human lung from exposure to PM containing known amounts of
              transition metals.",

              production in lungs following inhalation of particulate matter
              (PM) can result from redox-active chemicals, including iron and
              copper, but the relative importance of these species is unknown.
              This work investigates (•)OH production from iron, copper, and
              quinones, both individually and in mixtures at atmospherically
              relevant concentrations. Iron, copper, and three of the four
              quinones (1,2-naphthoquinone, phenanthrenequinone and
              1,4-naphthoquinone) produce (•)OH. Mixtures of copper or quinones
              with iron synergistically produce (•)OH at a rate 20-130\% higher
              than the sum of the rates of the individual redox-active species.
              We developed a regression equation from 20 mixtures to predict
              the rate of (•)OH production from the particle composition. For
              typical PM compositions, iron and copper account for most (•)OH
              production, whereas quinones are a minor source, although they
              can contribute if present at very high concentrations. This work
              shows that Cu contributes significantly to (•)OH production in
              ambient PM; other work has shown that Cu appears to be the
              primary driver of HOOH production and dithiothreitol (DTT) loss
              in ambient PM extracts. Taken together, these results indicate

  abstract  = "A new version of axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) called
               ADSA-NA (ADSA-no apex) was developed for measuring interfacial
               properties for drop configurations without an apex. ADSA-NA
               facilitates contact angle measurements on drops with a capillary
               protruding into the drop. Thus a much simpler experimental
               setup, not involving formation of a complete drop from below
               through a hole in the test surface, may be used. The contact
               angles of long-chained alkanes on a commercial fluoropolymer,
               Teflon AF 1600, were measured using the new method. A new
               numerical scheme was incorporated into the image processing to
               improve the location of the contact points of the liquid
               meniscus with the solid substrate to subpixel resolution. The
               images acquired in the experiments were also analyzed by a
               different drop shape technique called theoretical image fitting
               analysis-axisymmetric interfaces (TIFA-AI). The results were
               compared with literature values obtained by means of the
               standard ADSA for sessile drops with the apex. Comparison of the
               results from ADSA-NA with those from TIFA-AI and ADSA reveals
               that, with different numerical strategies and experimental
               setups, contact angles can be measured with an accuracy of less
               than 0.2 degrees. Contact angles and surface tensions measured
               from drops with no apex, i.e., by means of ADSA-NA and TIFA-AI,
               were considerably less scattered than those from complete drops
               with apex. ADSA-NA was also used to explore sources of
               improvement in contact angle resolution. It was found that using
               an accurate value of surface tension as an input enhances the
               accuracy of contact angle measurements.",

              the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics at the

              substantial progresses in the design of cheap, robust, and
              efficient catalysts are still required and have been considered a
              huge challenge. Herein, we report the simple synthesis and use of
              $\alpha$-Ni(OH)2 nanocrystals as a remarkably active and stable
              OER catalyst in alkaline media. We found the highly
              nanostructured $\alpha$-Ni(OH)2 catalyst afforded a current
              density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of a mere 0.331

              report the kinetic profiles of water splitting by a
              self-assembled nickel-borate (NiBi) OEC. Mechanistic studies of
              anodized films of NiBi exhibit the low Tafel slope of 2.3
              $\times$ RT/2F (30 mV/decade at 25 °C). This Tafel slope together
              with an inverse third order rate dependence on H(+) activity
              establishes NiBi as an ideal catalyst to be used in the
              construction of photoelectrochemical devices for water splitting.
              In contrast, nonanodized NiBi films display significantly poorer
              activity relative to their anodized congeners that we attribute
              to a more sluggish electron transfer from the catalyst resting
              state. Borate is shown to play two ostensibly antagonistic roles
              in OEC activity: as a promulgator of catalyst activity by
              enabling proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and as an
              inhibitor in its role as an adsorbate of active sites. By
              defining the nature of the PCET pre-equilibrium that occurs
              during turnover, trends in catalyst activity may be completely
              reversed at intermediate pH as compared to those at pH extremes.
              These results highlight the critical role of PCET pre-equilibria
              in catalyst self-assembly and turnover, and accordingly suggest a

              state changes. Coulometric measurements correlated with X-ray

              show that the nickel centers in activated films possess an
              average oxidation state of +3.6, indicating that a substantial
              proportion of nickel centers exist in a formal oxidation state of
              Ni(IV). In contrast, nickel centers in nonactivated films exist
              predominantly as Ni(III). Extended X-ray absorption fine

              bis-oxo/hydroxo-bridged nickel centers organized into sheets of

              distortion in the local coordination geometry about nickel
              centers, characteristic of Jahn-Teller distorted Ni(III) centers.
              Our findings indicate that the increase in catalytic activity of

              that are reminiscent of those observed for conversion of

               evolution reaction (OER) has drawn huge attention, but its
               efficiency still falls short of expectations. A widely accepted
               speculation is that the catalysts' activity is insufficient
               (high reaction barriers need to be overcome). Here, we develop a
               first-principles method to investigate the photocatalytic OER at
               the water/TiO2(110) interface. A full mechanism uncovering the
               importance of radicals is determined. Kinetic analysis further
               enables to quantitatively estimate each possible obstacle in the
               process. We demonstrate unambiguously that the rate-determining
               factor of the OER varies with the concentration of
               surface-reaching photoholes (Ch+). Under experimental
               conditions, the intrinsic catalytic activity of TiO2(110) does
               not represent the main obstacle, but all steps involving the
               photoholes are slow due to their low concentrations. This
               suggests that the key to enhance the OER efficiency is to
               increase Ch+ before Ch+ reaches the estimated threshold (Ch+ =
               ~10−4). A high reaction barrier is often assumed as the limiting
               factor in photocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions on titanium
               dioxide. Now, it is shown that the hole concentration at the
               semiconductor's surface is the actual bottleneck in determining
               the catalytic efficiency.",

              (LDH) was synthesized by a single step hydrothermal route using
              commercially available Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, TiCl4 and urea. The
              material exhibited significant absorption in the visible range
              with a very narrow band gap (2.68 eV). This could be attributed
              to structural defects as confirmed by diffuse reflectance
              spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL), X-ray diffraction
              (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.
              FT-IR, TGA, DTA, DSC, HR-TEM and SEM-EDX measurements yielded
              information about structural aspects, thermal stability and
              surface morphology. Surface and pore characteristics of the
              material were obtained from the BET isotherm for N2 adsorption at
              77 K. Zeta potential measurements were used to characterize the
              electrical properties of the surface while XPS revealed changes
              in surface states and oxygen deficiencies. The material was found
              to be an excellent photocatalyst for the degradation of aqueous
              methylene blue in visible light. The photocatalytic properties of
              the material were explained on the basis of the narrow band gap,
              the high surface area and the presence of surface defects. The
              photocatalytic activity improved in alkaline media [pH 11.0,

              $\times$ 10(-6) M (= 0.3198 mg L(-1))] due to the electrostatic
              attractions between the dye cations and the negative charges on
              the Ni/Ti LDH surface. The catalytic activity was found to be
              higher than the common commercial catalysts like ZnO, ZnS, NiO,
              TiO2 and Degussa P25. The catalytic activity was retained even
              after five methylene blue degradation cycles, demonstrating that
              the LDH could be an important addition to the field of wastewater
              treatment.",

              and suppression of backward reaction become particularly crucial.
              Herein, an all-in-one Pt·Ni(OH)2/C3N4 photocatalyst is proposed
              by integrating Pt@Ni(OH)2 composited nanowires and isolated Pt

              and Pt-O-Ni interaction retards OO bond cleavage thus inhibiting

              Schottky junction with C3N4 for electron transfer and proton
              reduction. Consequently, Pt·Ni(OH)2/C3N4 achieves stoichiometric

  abstract = "Nanosizing is the fashionable method to obtain a desirable
              electrode material for energy storage applications, and thus, a
              question arises: do smaller electrode materials exhibit better
              electrochemical performance? In this context, theoretical
              analyses on the particle size, band gap and conductivity of
              nano-electrode materials were performed; it was determined that a
              critical size exist between particle size and electrochemical
              performance. To verify this determination, for the first time, a
              scalable formation and disassociation of nickel-citrate complex
              approach was performed to synthesize ultra-small Ni(OH)2
              nanoparticles with different average sizes (3.3, 3.7, 4.4, 6.0,
              6.3, 7.9, 9.4, 10.0 and 12.2 nm). The best electrochemical
              performance was observed with a specific capacity of 406 C g−1,
              an excellent rate capability was achieved at a critical size of
              7.9 nm and a rapid decrease in the specific capacity was observed
              when the particle size was <7.9 nm. This result is because of the
              quantum confinement effect, which decreased the electrical
              conductivity and the sluggish charge and proton transfer. The
              results presented here provide a new insight into the nanosize

              and highly efficient energy generation to satisfy the energy
              needs of modern society. Among various advanced technologies,
              electrocatalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a
              key role and numerous new electrocatalysts have been developed to
              improve the efficiency of gas evolution. Along the way, enormous
              effort has been devoted to finding high-performance
              electrocatalysts, which has also stimulated the invention of new
              techniques to investigate the properties of materials or the
              fundamental mechanism of the OER. This accumulated knowledge not
              only establishes the foundation of the mechanism of the OER, but
              also points out the important criteria for a good electrocatalyst
              based on a variety of studies. Even though it may be difficult to
              include all cases, the aim of this review is to inspect the
              current progress and offer a comprehensive insight toward the
              OER. This review begins with examining the theoretical principles
              of electrode kinetics and some measurement criteria for achieving
              a fair evaluation among the catalysts. The second part of this
              review acquaints some materials for performing OER activity, in
              which the metal oxide materials build the basis of OER mechanism
              while non-oxide materials exhibit greatly promising performance
              toward overall water-splitting. Attention of this review is also
              paid to in situ approaches to electrocatalytic behavior during
              OER, and this information is crucial and can provide efficient
              strategies to design perfect electrocatalysts for OER. Finally,
              the OER mechanism from the perspective of both recent
              experimental and theoretical investigations is discussed, as well

              model materials, including layer-stacked bud-like Ni(OH)2-NB,
              flower-like Ni(OH)2-NF, and petal-like Ni(OH)2-NP as well as the
              ultralarge sheet-like Ni(OH)2-NS. For the first three
              (layer-stacking) catalysts, with the decrease of stacked layers,
              their accessible surface areas, abilities to adsorb OH-,
              diffusion properties, and the intrinsic activities of active
              sites increase, which accounts for their steadily enhanced
              activity. As expected, Ni(OH)2-NP shows the lowest overpotential
              (260 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and Tafel slope (78.6 mV dec-1) with a
              robust stability over 10 h among the samples, which also
              outperforms the benchmark IrO2 (360 mV and 115.8 mV dec-1)

              exhibits even faster substance diffusion due to the sheet-like
              structure, but shows inferior OER activity, which is mainly
              because the Ni(OH)2-NP with a smaller size possesses more active

              Ni(OH)2-NS, considering the adsorption properties and accessible

               catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have
               driven intensive research into the use of non-noble metal
               catalysts in recent years. As the most promising non-noble metal
               catalysts for PEMFC oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), metal/N/C
               class of catalysts has been extensively explored. Earlier
               efforts (1964--2004) were mainly focused on the exploration of
               various synthesis routes and the investigation of active site
               mechanisms. During recent years (2005--2010), great progress in
               the development of these types of non-noble metal catalysts in
               real PEMFC environments has been achieved both in terms of
               catalytic activity and stability. From 2011 to present, several
               new synthetic approaches have been explored to produce highly
               dense catalytically active sites decorated within micropores
               using rationally designed zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)
               and porous organic polymers (POPs). Currently, the most active
               non-noble metal catalysts are derived using this method and are
               able to deliver a kinetic volumetric current density of 450
               A/cm3 at 0.8 V under fuel cell operating conditions. These
               results are superior to the US DOE 2020 target of 300 A/cm3. In
               terms of fuel cell maximum power density, the best non-noble
               metal catalysts for cathodes can achieve results as high as 0.98
               W/cm2 and 0.41 W/cm2 with feeds of pure O2 and air respectively.
               In terms of stability, some non-noble metal catalysts have
               remained stable for over 1000 h with only minor degradation
               under PEMFC conditions. Nonetheless, activity and stability
               still remain major challenges for non-noble metal catalysts when
               compared to Pt-based ones in PEMFCs. Improvements in the
               structure of both catalysts and catalyst layers are urgently
               needed to realize the activity targets established for
               automobile fuel cell applications as well as the US DOE Hydrogen
               and Fuel Cell (H\&FC) program. In the long term and the
               sustainable commercialization of fuel cells, replacing Pt-based
               catalysts with non-noble metal catalysts is, in the present
               authors' opinion, the most sustainable solution. Therefore,
               further intensive research into fundamental studies is critical
               to uncovering the workings of active site mechanisms. Once
               controllable design and synthesize of non-noble metal catalysts
               with high active site densities and utilization can be achieved,
               the goal of cost-effective, non-noble metal catalysts in
               automobile fuel cells can become reality. \copyright{} 2018",

  abstract = "Semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted significant interest
              for solar light induced environmental remediation and solar fuel
              generation. As is well known, photocatalytic performance is
              determined by three steps: photoexcitation, separation and
              transport of photogenerated charge carriers, and surface
              reactions. To achieve higher efficiency, significant efforts have
              been made on improvement of efficiency of above first two steps,
              which have been well documented in recent review articles. In
              contrast, this review intends to focus on strategies moving onto
              the third step of improvement for enhanced photocatalysis wherein

               of life in an unprecedented way, but at the expense of
               increasing pressure on natural resources, environmental
               pollution and energy demand, which are being exacerbated by
               population growth and industrialization in developing countries.
               The energy demand probably is the one contributing the most to
               such a situation, thus urging the development of clean and
               renewable alternative energy sources in order to avoid an
               imminent energy crisis in the near future. A possible solution
               is a society in which most energy needs are fulfilled by
               photoinduced or electrochemical water-splitting, storing solar
               energy as hydrogen and dioxygen gas, and releasing the chemical
               energy in fuel cells while regenerating water. However, the
               oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction
               reaction taking place respectively in water-splitting and fuel
               cells are quite sluggish because of their multielectronic and
               multiprotonic nature. Catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are being
               successfully used as state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts but
               such noble metal-based materials are severely limited by their
               scarcity and high cost. Thus, noble metal free
               electro/photocatalysts are being eagerly pursued to provide more
               sustainable alternatives. In this context, vanadium-based and
               vanadium-containing electro and photocatalysts based on
               hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/oxides, vanadates, chalcogenides and
               nitrides stand out among the most promising alternatives, and
               recent advances have demonstrated their key role in enhancing
               the catalytic activity by strong synergic electronic and
               structural effects. In fact, such high-performance materials
               have potential in the fabrication of fuel cells and
               photosynthetic devices competitive enough in converting chemical
               energy into electricity and solar energy into solar fuel,
               enabling large-scale production, storage and usage of the
               infinite energy of the sun in a more convenient and safe manner.
               Perspectives are also provided on the preparation, evaluation of
               synergic effects in OER electro/photocatalytic activity, and

  abstract  = "Abstract In the search for nontoxic alternatives to lead-halide
               perovskites, bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) has emerged as a promising
               contender. BiOI is air-stable for over three months,
               demonstrates promising early-stage photovoltaic performance and,
               importantly, is predicted from calculations to tolerate vacancy
               and antisite defects. Here, whether BiOI tolerates point defects
               is experimentally investigated. BiOI thin films are annealed at
               a low temperature of 100 °C under vacuum (25 Pa absolute
               pressure). There is a relative reduction in the surface atomic
               fraction of iodine by over 40\%, reduction in the surface
               bismuth fraction by over 5\%, and an increase in the surface
               oxygen fraction by over 45\%. Unexpectedly, the Bi 4f7/2 core
               level position, Fermi level position, and valence band density
               of states of BiOI are not significantly changed. Further, the
               charge-carrier lifetime, photoluminescence intensity, and the
               performance of the vacuum-annealed BiOI films in solar cells
               remain unchanged. The results show BiOI to be electronically and
               optoelectronically robust to percent-level changes in surface
               composition. However, from photoinduced current transient
               spectroscopy measurements, it is found that the as-grown BiOI
               films have deep traps located $\approx$0.3 and 0.6 eV from the
               band edge. These traps limit the charge-carrier lifetimes of
               BiOI, and future improvements in the performance of BiOI
               photovoltaics will need to focus on identifying their origin.
               Nevertheless, these deep traps are three to four orders of
               magnitude less concentrated than the surface point defects
               induced through vacuum annealing. The charge-carrier lifetimes
               of the BiOI films are also orders of magnitude longer than if
               these surface defects were recombination active. This work
               therefore shows BiOI to be robust against processing conditions
               that lead to percent-level iodine-, bismuth-, and oxygen-related
               surface defects. This will simplify and reduce the cost of
               fabricating BiOI-based electronic devices, and stands in
               contrast to the defect-sensitivity of traditional covalent
               semiconductors.",

               processing methods and temperatures ($\leq$110 °C) that can be
               used to deposit the oxide overlayers, with the latter limiting
               the electronic properties of the oxides achievable. In this
               work, we demonstrate an alternative to existing methods that can
               grow pinhole-free TiOx (x ~ 2) films with the requisite
               thickness in 2\%. Likewise, when AP-CVD SnOx (x ~ 2) is grown
               directly on the perovskite, there is also minimal structural
               damage to the underlying perovskite layer. The SnOx layer is
               pinhole-free and conformal. When used to cover perovskite
               devices with a PC61BM electron transport layer, shunting due to
               the pinholes in the spin-coated PC61BM is reduced, resulting in
               increases in the steady-state efficiency from 16.5\% (no SnOx)
               to 19.4\% (60 nm SnOx), with fill factors reaching 84\%. This
               work shows AP-CVD to be a versatile technique for growing oxides

               developed towards its application for the next generation of
               micro/nanomedical and energy devices. In addition of analyzing
               the anodizing current profile, the surface morphology was
               characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), the
               crystalline structure by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and the
               mechanical properties by nanoindentation experiments. The
               anodizing time and applied potential determines the nanopores
               regularity and their size, although the effect of the potential
               is more pronounced than the effect of temperature in the
               transformation from crystalline alumina to amorphous alumina.
               Optimum pore growth was achieved with an applied potential of 17
               V which led to a pore fraction - P(f) - of about 17.5\%. The
               experimental Berkovich nanoindentation method was used to
               determine the AAO hardness as a function of the indenter depth,
               during the loading stage, using mechanical response and
               deformation behaviour of the nanopores structure. From the
               experimental data of the load-displacement curves, this method
               allows the calculation of the indenter contact depth at each
               reloading point, thus leading to the estimation of the materials
               hardness. The results reveal that the hardness depends on the
               processing conditions used for the production of the AAO samples

              alumina films formed in H2SO4 electrolyte at conditions different
              from those of best ordering. This is based on the combination of
              a suitable structural--kinetic model with the average size of
              imprints of barrier layer units on the Al surface determined by
              FESEM. The galvanostatic growth of films in steady state is
              accompanied by rise of anodic potential with time depending on
              temperature. Simultaneously structural features around the
              barrier layer like cell width, pore base diameter and barrier
              layer thickness increase with time and anodic potential. The
              ratios of their values remain constant in time but depend on
              temperature. A proportionality rule thus applies explained by
              demand for constant Al3+ and O2− transport numbers in steady
              state. The enlargement of the above structural features occurs
              simultaneously with termination of some pores due to their
              narrowing resulting from drop of ionic conductance in pores
              and/or barrier layer. The surface density of cells/pores across
              the film increases to film surface, where it becomes highest,

  abstract = "Chemical methods developed over the past two decades enable
              preparation of colloidal nanocrystals with uniform size and
              shape. These Brownian objects readily order into superlattices.
              Recently, the range of accessible inorganic cores and tunable
              surface chemistries dramatically increased, expanding the set of
              nanocrystal arrangements experimentally attainable. In this
              review, we discuss efforts to create next-generation materials
              via bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed
              functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is
              often driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence
              of the assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader
              with a practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis,
              self-assembly, and superlattice characterization. We then
              summarize the theory of nanocrystal interactions and examine
              fundamental principles governing nanocrystal self-assembly from
              hard and soft particle perspectives borrowed from the
              comparatively established fields of micrometer colloids and block
              copolymer assembly. We outline the extensive catalog of

              nanocrystals with spherical, polyhedral, rod, plate, and branched
              inorganic core shapes, as well as those obtained by mixing
              combinations thereof. We also provide an overview of structural
              defects in nanocrystal superlattices. We then explore the unique
              possibilities offered by leveraging nontraditional surface
              chemistries and assembly environments to control superlattice
              structure and produce nonbulk assemblies. We end with a

              catalytic properties of ordered nanocrystal superlattices, and
              the coming advances required to make use of this new class of

  abstract = "The controlled patterning of polymeric surfaces at the micro- and
              nanoscale offers potential in the technological development of
              small-scale devices, particularly within the fields of
              photovoltaics, micro-optics and lab- and organ-on-chip, where the
              topological arrangement of the surface can influence a system's
              power generation, optical properties or biological function -
              such as, in the latter case, biomimicking surfaces or topological
              control of cellular differentiation. One of the most promising
              approaches in reducing manufacturing costs and complexity is by
              exploitation of the self-assembling properties of colloidal
              particles. Self-assembly techniques can be used to produce
              colloidal crystals onto surfaces, which can act as replicative
              masks, as has previously been demonstrated with colloidal
              lithography, or templates in mold-replication methods with
              resolutions dependent on particle size. Within this context, a
              particular emerging interest is focused on the use of
              self-assembled colloidal crystal surfaces in polymer replication
              methods such as soft lithography, hot and soft embossing and
              nano-imprint lithography, offering low-cost and high-resolution
              alternatives to conventional lithographic techniques. However,
              there are still challenges to overcome for this surface
              patterning approach to reach a manufacturing reliability and
              process robustness comparable to competitive technologies already
              available in the market, as self-assembly processes are not
              always 100\% effective in organizing colloids within a structural
              pattern onto the surface. Defects often occur during template
              fabrication. Furthermore, issues often arise mainly at the
              interface between colloidal crystals and other surfaces and
              substrates. Particularly when utilized in high-temperature
              pattern replication processes, poor adhesion of colloidal
              particles onto the substrate results in degradation of the
              patterning template. These effects can render difficulties in
              creating stable structures with little defect that are well
              controlled such that a large variety of shapes can be reproduced
              reliably. This review presents an overview of available
              self-assembly methods for the creation of colloidal crystals,
              organized by the type of forces governing the self-assembly
              process: fluidic, physical, external fields, and chemical. The
              main focus lies on the use of spherical particles, which are
              favorable due to their high commercial availability and ease of
              synthesis. However, also shape-anisotropic particle self-assembly
              will be introduced, since it has recently been gaining research
              momentum, offering a greater flexibility in terms of patterning.
              Finally, an overview is provided of recent research on the

  abstract = "Anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) has been investigated and utilized
              in numerous products for almost a century. But the rapidly
              increasing interest in nanoscale materials and their outstanding
              properties has propelled nanoporous AAO to the fore as one of the
              most popular nanomaterial with applications across a gamut of
              areas including molecular separation, catalysis, energy
              generation and storage, electronics and photonics, sensors and
              biosensors, drug delivery and template synthesis. Material
              fabrication of AAO is based on facile and inexpensive
              electrochemical anodization with the self-ordering process of
              nanopores not requiring any lithography or templating, and the
              outcome of the process are perfectly ordered and size controlled
              nanopores with distinctive pore geometries. Recent research on
              AAO is characterized by a remarkable trajectory of innovation, in
              particular with regards to control of surface functionality and,
              concomitantly, to the design of intricate structural features
              such as modulated, branched, and multilayered pore architectures.
              This review illuminates research on recent development of AAO
              focussing on surface and structural engineering, and on emerging
              applications. Key examples and critical preparative issues and
              resulting improvements sparking opportunities for further
              applications in AAO properties are discussed. We conclude this
              review with an outlook providing a critical perspective on future
              trends on surface and structural engineering of AAO.",

               molecular species, and hydrous species in the sodium-depleted
               layers revealed correlations between subsurface structural
               changes and mechanical properties such as hardness, elastic
               modulus, and fracture toughness. A silica-like structure was
               created in the inert gas environment through restructuring of
               Si?O?Si bonds at 200°C in the Na-depleted zone; this occurred
               far below Tg. This silica-like surface also showed enhancement

               alignment to methylammonium (MA)PbI3, ZnO is largely overlooked
               due to a chemical instability when in contact with metal halide
               perovskites, which leads to rapid decomposition of the
               perovskite. While surface passivation techniques have somewhat

               present working inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for the
               first time. CsPbI3 normally resides in a yellow non-perovskite
               phase at room temperature, but by careful processing control and
               development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have
               stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room
               temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a
               variety of architectures, with current--voltage curve measured
               efficiency up to 2.9\% for a planar heterojunction architecture,
               and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7\%. The
               well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range
               electron and hole transport in this material. Importantly, this
               work identifies that the organic cation is not essential, but
               simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with
               good photovoltaic properties. We additionally observe
               significant rate-dependent current--voltage hysteresis in CsPbI3
               devices, despite the absence of the organic polar molecule
               previously thought to be a candidate for inducing hysteresis via
               ferroelectric polarisation. Due to its space group, CsPbI3
               cannot be a ferroelectric material, and thus we can conclude
               that ferroelectricity is not required to explain
               current--voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. Our
               report of working inorganic perovskite solar cells paves the way

              and M is Sn (1 and 2) or Pb (3 and 4) are reported. The compounds
              have been prepared through a variety of synthetic approaches, and
              the nature of the resulting materials is discussed in terms of
              their thermal stability and optical and electronic properties. We
              find that the chemical and physical properties of these materials
              strongly depend on the preparation method. Single crystal X-ray
              diffraction analysis of 1-4 classifies the compounds in the
              perovskite structural family. Structural phase transitions were
              observed and investigated by temperature-dependent single crystal
              X-ray diffraction in the 100-400 K range. The charge transport
              properties of the materials are discussed in conjunction with
              diffuse reflectance studies in the mid-IR region that display
              characteristic absorption features. Temperature-dependent studies
              show a strong dependence of the resistivity as a function of the
              crystal structure. Optical absorption measurements indicate that
              1-4 behave as direct-gap semiconductors with energy band gaps
              distributed in the range of 1.25-1.75 eV. The compounds exhibit
              an intense near-IR photoluminescence (PL) emission in the
              700-1000 nm range (1.1-1.7 eV) at room temperature. We show that
              solid solutions between the Sn and Pb compounds are readily
              accessible throughout the composition range. The optical
              properties such as energy band gap, emission intensity, and
              wavelength can be readily controlled as we show for the
              isostructural series of solid solutions CH3NH3Sn(1-x)Pb(x)I3 (5).
              The charge transport type in these materials was characterized by
              Seebeck coefficient and Hall-effect measurements. The compounds
              behave as p- or n-type semiconductors depending on the
              preparation method. The samples with the lowest carrier
              concentration are prepared from solution and are n-type; p-type
              samples can be obtained through solid state reactions exposed in
              air in a controllable manner. In the case of Sn compounds, there
              is a facile tendency toward oxidation which causes the materials
              to be doped with Sn(4+) and thus behave as p-type semiconductors
              displaying metal-like conductivity. The compounds appear to
              possess very high estimated electron and hole mobilities that
              exceed 2000 cm(2)/(V s) and 300 cm(2)/(V s), respectively, as

               several classes of semiconducting compounds with electronic
               structures similar to those of hybrid lead--halide perovskites.
               In this work, we reflect on the accuracy and prospects of these
               new design criteria through a combined experimental and
               theoretical approach. We construct a model to extract
               photoluminescence lifetimes of six of these candidate PV
               absorbers, including four (InI, SbSI, SbSeI, and BiOI) for which
               time-resolved photoluminescence has not been previously
               reported. The lifetimes of all six candidate materials exceed 1
               ns, a threshold for promising early stage PV device performance.
               However, there are variations between these materials, and none
               achieve lifetimes as high as those of the hybrid lead--halide
               perovskites, suggesting that the heuristics for defect-tolerant

               development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have
               stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room
               temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a
               variety of architectures, with current--voltage curve measured
               efficiency up to 2.9\% for a planar heterojunction architecture,
               and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7\%. The
               well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range

              hybrid perovskites-such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)-have
              attracted attention as light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic
              solar cells. So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in
              a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using a mixture
              of PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent. However, the
              uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large
              morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of
              photovoltaic performance in the resulting devices, which hampers
              the prospects for practical applications. Here we describe a
              sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite
              pigment within the porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first
              introduced from solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film
              and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by exposing it
              to a solution of CH3NH3I. We find that the conversion occurs
              within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come
              into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite
              morphology than is possible with the previously employed route.
              Using this technique for the fabrication of solid-state
              mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the reproducibility of
              their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion

              AM1.5G test conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light
              intensity and cell temperature). This two-step method should

               metrics of the leading optometric researchers worldwide.Methods:
               An extensive global search was conducted to discover leading
               optometric researchers; 480 names were identified. A
               custom-designed bibliographic search tool was developed to
               interrogate the Scopus database (Elsevier) and extract
               publication metrics using the unique Scopus Author Identifier
               number for each optometrist. On 13 January 2021, the full list
               was reduced to 200 optometrists (the ?Top 200?) ranked by
               h-index ? the ?Global Optometrist Top 200 Research Ranking?. The
               output from the custom tool automatically updates every 24 hours
               and is available at www.optomrankings.com.Results: The Top 200
               have h-indices ranging from 20 to 67 and have published between
               28 and 440 papers. Sixty one (30.5\%) are women. Konrad Pesudovs
               has the highest h-index (67) and citations (51,193). The most
               prolific author is Robert Hess (442 papers). David Pi{\~n}ero is

               candidates for the top cell in multijunction/tandem devices due
               to the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and relatively low
               voltage loss. Herein, sandwiched gold nanomesh between MoO3
               layers is designed as a transparent electrode. The large surface
               tension of MoO3 effectively improves wettability for gold,
               resulting in Frank?van der Merwe growth to produce an ultrathin
               gold nanomesh layer, which guarantees not only excellent
               conductivity but also great optical transparency, which is
               particularly important for a multijunction/tandem solar cell.
               The top MoO3 layer reduces the reflection at the gold layer to
               further increase light transmission. As a result, the
               semitransparent perovskite cell shows an 18.3\% efficiency, the
               highest reported for this type of device. When the

               combined efficiency of 27.0\%, higher than those of both the
               sub-cells. This breakthrough in elevating the efficiency of

               conversion efficiency of just over 30\% is achievable by
               harvesting UV to near IR photons up to 1.1 eV. Dye‐sensitized
               solar cells (DSCs) are, however, not ideal. Here, the electrical
               and optical losses in the dye‐sensitized system are reviewed,
               and the main losses in potential from the conversion of an
               absorbed photon at the optical bandgap of the sensitizer to the

              forms an exceptional gradually-organized multi-dimensional

              architecture, and 14.6\% in standard mesoporous solar cells. To

               procedure that involves the use of organic solvents. In this
               case the solubility of vanillin and its extractability from
               vanilla pods in 14 NADES was evaluated. The solubility in some
               NADES such as lactic acid: propanediol (620 mg/mL) and lactic
               acid: fructose (320 mg/mL) was found to be almost similar to
               that of organic solvents e.g. methanol (632.94 mg/mL) or ethanol
               (375.81 mg/mL). Interestingly, the extractability of vanillin
               from vanilla pods did not reflect the results observed for the
               solubility tests. Some NADES with constituents that are suitable
               as food ingredients such as citric acid-fructose-glucose (CAFG),
               fructose-glucose (FG), malic acid-glucose (MAG), and malic

               (4.4 mg/g DW). The discrepancy between solubility and
               extractability might be due to differences in the interaction
               with the matrix depending on the NADES. The effect of water
               content in some NADES on the extractability of vanillin was also
               studied. With the high extraction capacity and the absence of
               toxicity of their components, NADES are very suitable for

               perovskite (HOIP) photovoltaic devices has attracted a great
               deal of attention due to their very high conversion efficiencies
               and straightforward fabrication methods. Unfortunately, a major
               obstacle to commercialization remains the high toxicity of lead.
               Whilst to date the focus has been on understanding and improving
               device performance, there has been no reported effort to develop
               methods to recover and recycle the lead from these materials. In
               this work we demonstrate a simple, low-cost and environmentally
               friendly method of recycling lead from HOIP photovoltaics by
               dissolution and selective electrodeposition using a deep
               eutectic solvent. We demonstrate that up to 99.8\% of the lead
               is removed from the solvent. The results presented here provide
               a viable solution to lead-based HOIP photovoltaic recycling, and
               also open the possibility for providing an alternative method to
               conventional smelting in the recovery and recycling of different

               is a universal post-treatment method for perovskite films
               preparation. Moreover, thermal management highly depends on
               perovskite materials. However, no specialized study has been
               reported on CsFAMA perovskite to date. Herein, we have
               systematically investigated the influence of thermal annealing
               and annealing time on CsFAMA films and their solar cells. We
               demonstrated that heating time of 45 or 60 min at 100 °C is
               desirable. More interestingly, we found that the unannealed
               CsFAMA films exhibit ultrahigh photoluminescence (PL)
               intensities, much stronger than that of annealed films. Note
               that PL intensities gradually weaken as a function of annealing
               time. In particular, the PL intensities of fresh films (after
               antisolvent dripping) are at least 200 times higher than that of
               60 min annealed films. To our knowledge, it is the first time to
               report this PL behavior. We speculate that it is due to quantum
               confinement effect of perovskite crystal nuclei and ``cage

               materials that can exhibit high toughness while retaining
               self-healing characteristics. This behavior results from the
               random distribution of oppositely charged monomers along the
               polymer chains that form transient bonds with a range of bond
               strengths. PAs can be dissolved in aqueous salt solutions and
               then recast via immersion precipitation, making them
               particularly useful as surface coatings in biomedical
               applications. Moreover, this immersion precipitation technique
               allows these PA hydrogels to be fabricated into films less than
               100 nm. One critical challenge to this aqueous processing method
               is the recrystallization of the salt upon water evaporation.
               Such recrystallization can disrupt the hydrogel morphology
               especially in thin films. In this study, a deep eutectic solvent
               (DES) formed from urea and choline chloride was used to dissolve

               has a freezing point of 12 °C, allowing it to remain stable and
               liquid-like at room temperatures. Thus, these PAs can be
               processed in DES solutions, without this issue of
               recrystallization and with simple methods such as spin coating
               and dip coating. These methods allow these hydrogels to be used

               NADES applications have been developed in the past several
               years. However, unlike organic solvents, the basic structural
               unit of NADES media primarily depends on the intermolecular
               interactions among their components. This makes NADES matrices
               readily influenced by various factors, such as water content,
               temperature, and component ratio and, thus, extends the

               understanding of the importance of NADES in biological systems,
               this review focuses on NADES properties and applications in NP

               analysis of existing report adds to the recognition of the
               distinctiveness of (NA)DES, involves a discussion of

               required to fabricate high-performance photovoltaic (PV)
               devices. Organo-metal halide perovskite materials, however,
               exhibit a large degree of tolerance in synthesis and can be
               fabricated into high efficiency devices by a variety of
               different vacuum and solution-based processes, with a wide range
               of precursor ratios. This suggests that the phase field for the
               desired material is wider than expected or that high device
               efficiency may be achieved with a range of phases. Here, we
               investigate the structural and optical properties of the
               materials formed when a range of compositions of methylammonium
               iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) were reacted at temperatures
               from 40 to 190 °C. The reactions were performed according to a
               commonly employed synthetic approach for high efficiency PV
               devices, and the data was analyzed to construct a pseudobinary,
               temperature-dependent, phase-composition processing diagram.
               Escape of MAI vapor at the highest temperatures (150--190 °C)
               enabled a PbI2 phase to persist to very high MAI concentrations,
               and the processing diagram was not representative of phase
               equilibrium in this range. Data from reactions performed with a
               fixed vapor pressure of MAI allowed the high temperature portion
               of the diagram to be corrected and a near-equilibrium phase
               diagram to be proposed. The perovskite phase field is wider than
               previously thought under both processing conditions and extended
               by the existence of stacked perovskite sheet phases. Several

               material has become imperative to achieve high power conversion
               efficiencies. Despite the fact that nucleation plays a key role
               in controlling the crystal morphology, very little is known
               about the nucleation and crystal growth processes. Here, we
               perform metadynamics simulations of nucleation of methylammonium
               lead triiodide (MAPI) in order to unravel the atomistic details
               of perovskite crystallization from a $\gamma$-butyrolactone
               solution. The metadynamics trajectories show that the nucleation
               process takes place in several stages. Initially, dense
               amorphous clusters mainly consisting of lead and iodide appear
               from the homogeneous solution. These clusters evolve into lead
               iodide (PbI2)-like structures. Subsequently, methylammonium
               (MA+) ions diffuse into these PbI2-like aggregates triggering
               the transformation into a perovskite crystal through a
               solid--solid transformation. These enticing results allowed us
               to design new experimental strategies to rationally control the

               to engineer homogeneous nucleation and growth of MAPI single

               cells has exceeded 23\%, the poor ambient stability of
               organic--inorganic halide perovskites poses a challenge for
               their commercialization. Comprehensive understanding of the
               underlying degradation mechanisms is a crucial step to seek
               approaches that can effectively suppress the degradation of
               perovskites. Herein, on the basis of extensive first-principles
               calculations, a three-step photo-oxidative degradation mechanism
               of MAPbI3 at the atomic level is revealed. We find that, in a
               dry ambient environment, the photo-generated superoxide anions
               (O2−) first lead to fast surface oxidation. However, further
               oxidation of the perovskite interior is hindered by the solid
               oxidation product. The fresh water produced in surface oxidation
               leads to the hydration of the inner perovskite and eventual
               breakage of the MAPbI3 lattice. We devise a practical strategy
               for protecting MAPbI3 from photo-induced decomposition by
               anchoring hydrophobic 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine on the
               surface of MAPbI3. The surface modification significantly

               was performed to control the quality of the PbI2 and MAPbI3
               perovskite layers. Two small organic molecules, each with a
               different backbone, 3-aminopropanoic acid (APA) and
               4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), were selected and their solvation
               effects were also investigated. Small homogeneously distributed
               cracks were found in the PbI2 film produced from the
               modification with APA molecules in demethyl sulfoxide or ethanol
               solution, whereas films produced from modification with ABA
               molecules showed different effects. These small cavities act as
               pathway for MAI intercalation and facilate PbI2-to-MAPbI3
               conversion, leading to PbI2-free perovskite film. The different
               morphologies were caused by different adsorption behaviors of
               each SAM on the TiO2 surface. APA molecules interact with the
               hydroxyl groups of TiO2 while ABA molecules do not. Therefore,
               with APA treatment, the perovskite solar cells showed
               improvements in power conversion efficiency in comparison to
               either the devices without surface modification or ones treated
               with ABA molecules. The reasons behind the enhancement are
               attributed to longer charge carrier lifetime and better charge
               transfer at the TiO2/APA/perovskite interface. The results imply
               that the choice selected for SAMs and their solvents are crucial

               thermally evaporated methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) on a lead
               iodide (PbI2) film. This deposition method mimics the ?two-step?
               synthesis method commonly used in device fabrication. We find
               that several competing processes occur during the formation of
               perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. Our most important finding is that during
               vapour deposition of CH3NH3I onto PbI2, at least two carbon
               species are present in the resulting material, while only one
               nitrogen species is present. This suggests that CH3NH3I can
               dissociate during the transition to a perovskite phase, and some
               of the resulting molecules can be incorporated into the
               perovskite. The effect of partial CH3NH3 substitution with CH3
               was evaluated, and electronic structure calculations show that

               variable‐sized crystals ($\approx$100 nm--10 µm) are found to be

               calculations suggest that overall Gibbs free energy in alcohols

               structure of choline chloride-malic acid (malicine) as a liquid,
               and also in solid and hydrated forms, using neutron total
               scattering on D/H isotope-substituted samples, and quasi-elastic
               neutron scattering (QENS). Data were refined using empirical
               potential structure refinement. We show evidence for a
               stoichiometric complex ion cluster in the disordered liquid,
               with strong choline--chloride bonding and a hydrogen bond donor
               (HBD) contribution. The 1:1 eutectic stoichiometry makes these
               ionic domains more well-defined, with less HBD clustering than
               seen previously for reline. There is minimal structural
               difference for the solidified material, demonstrating that this
               DES solidification is a glass transition rather than a first
               order phase change. QENS data support this by showing a gradual
               change in solvent dynamics rather than a step change. The DES
               structure is mostly retained upon hydration, with water acting
               both as a secondary smaller HBD at closer range to choline than
               malic acid, and forming transient wormlike aggregates. This new
               understanding of DES structure will aid understanding of the

              (Treh) and glycerol (Gly) in cryopreservation, as cryoprotective

              reduce the number of ice crystals and hence ice crystal damage in
              cells, which is a crucial parameter for their survival, upon
              freezing. Using this NADES as CPA, it is possible to achieve
              similar or even better cellular performance when compared with

              liquids, apart from water and lipids. NADES show promise as drug
              carriers in dermal formulations or formulations for local
              administration in the oral cavity due to their low toxicity,
              tunability and biodegradability as well as their solubilizing and
              stabilizing properties. However, a thorough investigation of
              their effects in a biological system is needed. The present study
              aimed to investigate the physicochemical properties of six
              selected NADES and dilutions thereof. Further, the suitability of
              NADES as vehicles in topical preparations was evaluated through
              the application of liposome model membranes and ex vivo pig skin
              models. The effects of NADES on the membrane stability of
              egg-phosphatidylcholine (Egg-PC) liposomes and
              1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 16:0 PC (DPPC)
              liposomes were investigated by physical stability studies,
              membrane permeability studies, calorimetric analysis and visual
              representation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The
              liposomes appeared in most cases physically stable for 24 h in
              NADES, although there were changes in size and morphology most
              likely related to increased osmolality. Some NADES were also able
              to disaggregate formed DPPC liposome aggregates. The ex vivo
              permeation studies indicated a slightly reduced permeability of
              chloramphenicol through the pig skin after NADES application,
              which most likely was caused by hydrogen bonding between the
              NADES and proteins in the skin based on FT-IR-results.
              Altogether, our findings suggest that NADES are promising drug

               − xBrx)3 (x = 0.1--0.15) as the absorbing layer and
               poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a
               mixed solvent of $\gamma$-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide
               (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely
               uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I--PbI2--DMSO
               intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably
               improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion
               efficiency of 16.2\% and no hysteresis. These results provide
               important progress towards the understanding of the role of
               solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly
               efficient perovskite solar cells. The performance of solar cells
               based on organic--inorganic perovskites strongly depends on the
               device architecture and processing conditions. It is now shown
               that solvent engineering enables the deposition of very dense
               perovskite layers on mesoporous titania, leading to photovoltaic
               devices with a high light-conversion efficiency and no

              reactions starting from CO2 and light. Direct capture of solar
              energy for organic synthesis is a promising approach. Lead

  abstract  = "ConspectusA new front-runner has emerged in the field of
               next-generation photovoltaics. A unique class of materials,
               known as organic metal halide perovskites, bridges the gap
               between low-cost fabrication and exceptional device performance.
               These compounds can be processed at low temperature (typically
               in the range 80--150 °C) and readily self-assemble from the
               solution phase into high-quality semiconductor thin films. The
               low energetic barrier for crystal formation has mixed
               consequences. On one hand, it enables inexpensive processing and
               both optical and electronic tunability. The caveat, however, is
               that many as-formed lead halide perovskite thin films lack
               chemical and structural stability, undergoing rapid degradation
               in the presence of moisture or heat.To date, improvements in
               perovskite solar cell efficiency have resulted primarily from
               better control over thin film morphology, manipulation of the
               stoichiometry and chemistry of lead halide and alkylammonium
               halide precursors, and the choice of solvent treatment. Proper
               characterization and tuning of processing parameters can aid in
               rational optimization of perovskite devices. Likewise, gaining a
               comprehensive understanding of the degradation mechanism and
               identifying components of the perovskite structure that may be
               particularly susceptible to attack by moisture are vital to
               mitigate device degradation under operating conditions.This
               Account provides insight into the lifecycle of
               organic--inorganic lead halide perovskites, including (i) the
               nature of the precursor solution, (ii) formation of solid-state
               perovskite thin films and single crystals, and (iii)
               transformation of perovskites into hydrated phases upon exposure
               to moisture. In particular, spectroscopic and structural
               characterization techniques shed light on the thermally driven
               evolution of the perovskite structure. By tuning precursor
               stoichiometry and chemistry, and thus the lead halide
               charge-transfer complexes present in solution, crystallization
               kinetics can be tailored to yield improved thin film
               homogeneity. Because degradation of the as-formed perovskite
               film is in many ways analogous to its initial formation, the
               same suite of monitoring techniques reveals the moisture-induced
               transformation of low band gap methylammonium lead iodide
               (CH3NH3PbI3) to wide band gap hydrate compounds. The rate of
               degradation is increased upon exposure to light. Interestingly,
               the hydration process is reversible under certain conditions.
               This facile formation and subsequent chemical lability raises
               the question of whether CH3NH3PbI3 and its analogues are
               thermodynamically stable phases, thus posing a significant
               challenge to the development of transformative perovskite
               photovoltaics. Adequately addressing issues of structural and
               chemical stability under real-world operating conditions is
               paramount if perovskite solar cells are to make an impact beyond
               the benchtop. Expanding our fundamental knowledge of lead halide
               perovskite formation and degradation pathways can facilitate
               fabrication of stable, high-quality perovskite thin films for
               the next generation of photovoltaic and light emitting devices.",

              in this process, could be made clear by the combined ab initio
              calculations and the X-ray absorption measurements. The junctions
              of MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) with pure GaN and ZnO crystals, oriented
              with the polar [0 0 0 1] and [0 0 0 −1] surfaces, are
              theoretically investigated by means of the density functional
              theory (DFT) and simulations of the X-ray absorption near-edge
              spectroscopy (XANES). Unwanted decomposition of the perovskite,
              into the layers which are parallel to the interface, coexists
              with a strong binding of the halide atom at GaN [0 0 0 1] and ZnO
              [0 0 0 1]. In contrast, at the interfaces with the [0 0 0
              −1]-oriented GaN and ZnO, aforementioned segmentation of the
              perovskite does not occur, because binding of the halide atom is
              much weaker. Thus, the adsorption properties of the halide atom
              at semiconductor surface might be a precondition for a choice of

              implied a large-scale synthesis of the nanocrystals. Following
              this, ~ 1 g of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were obtained only in the
              10-mL octane solution when the concentration of PbBr2 was up to
              0.3 mol/L. This one-pot process was suitable for the large-scale
              and cost-effective synthesis of CsPbX3 nanocrystals. Besides, the
              obtained CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were used as probes of the [Zn2+]
              detection for the first time. It was found that the Zn2+ ions
              could quench the photoluminescence intensity of CsPbX3
              nanocrystals and the quench effect showed high selectivity and

               the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells by
               any antisolvent via manipulation of the antisolvent application
               rate. Through detailed structural, compositional, and
               microstructural characterization of perovskite layers fabricated
               by 14 different antisolvents, we identify two key factors that
               influence the quality of the perovskite layer: the solubility of
               the organic precursors in the antisolvent and its miscibility
               with the host solvent(s) of the perovskite precursor solution,
               which combine to produce rate-dependent behavior during the
               antisolvent application step. Leveraging this, we produce
               devices with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that exceed
               21\% using a wide range of antisolvents. Moreover, we
               demonstrate that employing the optimal antisolvent application

               fabricated from a broad range of precursor stoichiometries. Thin

               transformative impact on the renewable energy landscape since
               they were first demonstrated just over a decade ago. Outstanding
               improvements in performance have been demonstrated through
               structural, compositional, and morphological control of devices,
               with commercialization now being a reality. Here the authors
               present an aerosol assisted solvent treatment as a universal
               method to obtain performance and stability enhancements in PSCs,
               demonstrating their methodology as a convenient, scalable, and
               reproducible post-deposition treatment for PSCs. Their results
               identify improvements in crystallinity and grain size,
               accompanied by a narrowing in grain size distribution as the
               underlying physical changes that drive reductions of electronic
               and ionic defects. These changes lead to prolonged
               charge-carrier lifetimes and ultimately increased device
               efficiencies. The versatility of the process is demonstrated for
               PSCs with thick (>1 µm) active layers, large-areas (>1 cm2) and
               a variety of device architectures and active layer compositions.
               This simple post-deposition process is widely transferable
               across the field of perovskites, thereby improving the future

               low-bandgap absorbers for all-perovskite tandem solar cells that
               offer higher efficiencies than single-junction devices. A
               significant barrier to higher performance and stability is the
               ready oxidation of tin, commonly mitigated by various additives
               whose impact is still poorly understood for mixed tin-lead
               perovskites. Here, the effects of the commonly used SnF2
               additive are revealed for FA0.83Cs0.17SnxPb1?xI3 perovskites
               across the full compositional lead-tin range and SnF2
               percentages of 0.1?20\% of precursor tin content. SnF2 addition
               causes a significant reduction in the background hole density
               associated with tin vacancies, yielding longer photoluminescence
               lifetimes, decreased energetic disorder, reduced Burstein?Moss
               shifts, and higher charge-carrier mobilities. Such effects are
               optimized for SnF2 addition of 1\%, while for 5\% SnF2 and
               above, additional nonradiative recombination pathways begin to
               appear. It is further found that the addition of SnF2 reduces a

               the presence of tin vacancies that cause strain, particularly

               require mixed-metal Pb--Sn compositions to achieve narrower band
               gaps than are possible with their neat Pb counterparts. The
               lower band gap range achievable with mixed-metal Pb--Sn
               perovskites also encompasses the 1.3 to 1.4 eV range that is
               theoretically ideal for maximising the efficiency of
               single-junction devices. Here we examine the optoelectronic
               quality and photovoltaic performance of the
               ((HC(NH2)2)0.83Cs0.17)(Pb1−ySny)I3 family of perovskite
               materials across the full range of achievable band gaps by
               substituting between 0.001\% and 70\% of the Pb content with Sn.
               We reveal that a compositional range of ``defectiveness'' exists
               when Sn comprises between 0.5\% and 20\% of the metal content,
               but that the optoelectronic quality is restored for Sn content
               between 30--50\%. When only 1\% of Pb content is replaced by Sn,
               we find that photoconductivity, photoluminescence lifetime, and
               photoluminescence quantum efficiency are reduced by at least an
               order of magnitude, which reveals that a small concentration of
               Sn incorporation produces trap sites that promote non-radiative
               recombination in the material and limit photovoltaic
               performance. While these observations suggest that band gaps

               optoelectronic applications without countermeasures to improve
               material quality, highly efficient narrower band gap absorber
               materials are possible at or below 1.33 eV. Through optimising
               single-junction photovoltaic devices with Sn compositions of
               30\% and 50\%, we respectively demonstrate a 17.6\% efficient
               solar cell with an ideal single-junction band gap of 1.33 eV and

               perovskite thin films by depositing a layer of PbI2 then
               reacting it with CH3NH3I (MAI) vapor. We find that, at T = 100
               °C and pressure = 9 torr, a ∼225 nm-thick PbI2 film requires
               $\geq$125 minutes in MAI vapor to form a fully-reacted MAPI
               film. Raising the temperature to 160 °C increases the rate of
               reaction, such that MAPI forms within 15 minutes, but with
               reduced surface coverage. The reaction kinetics can be
               approximated as roughly first-order with respect to PbI2, though
               there is evidence for a more complicated functional relation.

               parameters with values collected from commercial module data

               that (i) hydrated crystal phases are formed when MAPI is exposed
               to water vapor at room temperature and (ii) these phase changes
               are fully reversed when the material is subsequently dried. The
               reversible formation of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O followed by
               (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O (upon long exposure times) was observed using
               time-resolved XRD and ellipsometry of thin films prepared using
               ``solvent engineering'', single crystals, and state-of-the-art
               solar cells. In contrast to water vapor, the presence of liquid
               water results in the irreversible decomposition of MAPI to form
               PbI2. MAPI changes from dark brown to transparent on hydration;
               the precise optical constants of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O formed on single
               crystals were determined, with a bandgap at 3.1 eV. Using the
               single-crystal optical constants and thin-film ellipsometry
               measurements, the time-dependent changes to MAPI films exposed
               to moisture were modeled. The results suggest that the
               monohydrate phase forms independent of the depth in the film,
               suggesting rapid transport of water molecules along grain
               boundaries. Vapor-phase hydration of an unencapsulated solar
               cell (initially Jsc $\approx$ 19 mA cm--2 and Voc $\approx$ 1.05
               V at 1 sun) resulted in more than a 90\% drop in short-circuit
               photocurrent and ∼200 mV loss in open-circuit potential;
               however, these losses were fully reversed after the device was
               exposed to dry nitrogen for 6 h. Hysteresis in the
               current--voltage characteristics was significantly increased
               after this dehydration, which may be related to changes in the
               defect density and morphology of MAPI following
               recrystallization from the hydrate. Based on our observations,
               we suggest that irreversible decomposition of MAPI in the
               presence of water vapor only occurs significantly once a grain
               has been fully converted to the monohydrate phase.",

               that impede perovskite solar cell commercialization. Here we
               show that a thin layer of a functional hygroscopic polymer,
               poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, on top of the perovskite thin film,
               can make perovskite-based solar cells highly stable during
               operation and in a humid atmosphere. We prove that PEO
               chemically interacts with lead ions on the perovskite surface,
               and thus passivates undercoordinated defect sites. Importantly,
               defect healing by PEO not only results in an improvement of the
               photo-voltage but also makes the perovskite thin film stable. We
               demonstrate that the hygroscopic PEO thin film can prevent water
               inclusion into the perovskite film by screening water molecules,
               thus having a multi-functional role. Overall, such interface

               (ILs) have gained enormous attention from the scientific
               community, and the number of reported articles in the literature
               has grown exponentially. Nevertheless, IL ``greenness'' is often
               challenged, mainly due to their poor biodegradability,
               biocompatibility, and sustainability. An alternative to ILs are
               deep eutectic solvents (DES). Deep eutectic solvents are defined
               as a mixture of two or more components, which may be solid or
               liquid and that at a particular composition present a high
               melting point depression becoming liquids at room temperature.
               When the compounds that constitute the DES are primary
               metabolites, namely, aminoacids, organic acids, sugars, or
               choline derivatives, the DES are so called natural deep eutectic
               solvents (NADES). NADES fully represent green chemistry
               principles. Can natural deep eutectic solvents be foreseen as
               the next generation solvents and can a similar path to ionic
               liquids be outlined? The current state of the art concerning the
               advances made on these solvents in the past few years is
               reviewed in this paper, which is more than an overview on the

               hints at the extraction of phenolic compounds from green coffee

               speciation in the DES electrolyte can be modified, as confirmed
               by Raman, NMR and IR spectroscopy. We correlate the speciation
               changes to resulting battery performance by systematic
               electrochemical investigations of Al-graphite batteries

  abstract  = "The liquid structure of a representative of the first
               water-in-salt (WiS) Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES),
               hereinafter indicated as aquoline, a mixture of choline chloride
               (ChCl) and water with molar ratio 1:3.33, is explored at ambient
               conditions. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation tools, we
               extract structural information at atomistic level on the nature
               of inter-correlations between the different moieties. Despite
               being a very fluid liquid, with much lower viscosity than other
               common ChCl-based DES, aquoline turns out to be very structured.
               Computed X-ray and neutron weighted scattering patterns (the
               latter also on selectively deuterated mixtures) highlight the
               existence of mesoscopic organization that is rationalised in
               terms of choline vs. water/chloride structural alternation. The
               study shows that choline cations are highly coordinating the
               surrounding environment: strong hydrogen bonding mediated
               correlations between the hydroxyl group and water or chloride
               are detected. In addition, the ammonium group drives the
               formation of a complex solvating environment, with water,
               chloride and hydroxyl moieties approaching it, between the
               hindering methyl groups. Strong hydrogen-bonding interactions
               between water molecules and between water and anions are
               detected and, while water cannot create a bulk water-like
               environment around itself, its network with neighbour water or
               anions develops long chains across the bulk phase. This is a
               first study that will be extended based on complementary
               experimental work as a function of water content and
               temperature/pressure, to explore structural and dynamic
               properties of this class of materials. \copyright{} 2021

              related to the stability under various conditions and toxicity
              issues. A huge number of articles have been published in PSCs in
              the recent years focusing these issues by employing different
              strategies in the synthesis of electron transport layer (ETL),
              active perovskite layer, hole transport layer (HTL) and back
              contact counter electrodes. This article tends to focus on the
              role and classification of different materials used as HTL in
              influencing long-term stability, in improving the photovoltaic
              parameters and thereby enhancing the device efficiency. Hole
              Transport Materials (HTMs) are categorized by dividing into three
              primary types, namely; organic, inorganic and carbonaceous HTMs.
              To analyze the role of HTM in detail, we further divide these
              primary type of HTMs into different subgroups. The organic-based
              HTMs are subdivided into three categories, namely; long polymer
              HTMs, small molecule HTMs and cross-linked polymers and the
              inorganic HTMs have been classified into nickel (Ni) derivatives
              and copper (Cu) derivatives based HTMs, p-type semiconductor
              based HTMs and transition metal based HTMs. We further analyze
              the dual role of carbonaceous materials as HTM and counter
              electrode in the perovskite devices. In addition, in this review,
              an overview of the preparation methods, and the influence of the
              thickness of the HTM layers on the performance and stability of
              the perovskite devices are also provided. We have carried out a

              based on their cost-effectiveness and considering their role on
              effective device performance. This review further discusses the
              critical challenges involved in the synthesis and device
              engineering of HTMs. This will provide the reader a better

               By post-processing the as-deposited tin--lead perovskite films
               with methylammonium chloride vapor, we increase grain sizes to
               over a micron and boost solar cell open circuit voltage and fill
               factor. Tin--lead perovskite solar cells made by this method
               exhibit the most stable operation at maximum power under
               simulated sunlight of any reported small bandgap perovskite
               solar cell to date. We show that an unencapsulated tin--lead
               perovskite solar cell maintains its full performance after 150
               hours at 85C in air, which is substantially better than has been
               observed previously. This work identifies strategies for
               attaining highly efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells
               while maintaining thermal and operational stability.",

               a simple electrochemical deposition method for quickly and

               condition for preparing NiOx films is achieved by adjusting the
               deposition time at a certain applied current density, which
               exhibits excellent optical transmittance and suitable thickness

              candidates for high efficiency low cost tandem photovoltaics, in
              part because they have band gaps that can be tuned over a wide
              range by compositional substitution. We experimentally identify
              two competing mechanisms through which the A-site cation
              influences the band gap of 3D metal halide perovskites. Using a
              smaller A-site cation can distort the perovskite lattice in two
              distinct ways: by tilting the MX6 octahedra or by simply
              contracting the lattice isotropically. The former effect tends to
              raise the band gap, while the latter tends to decrease it. Lead
              iodide perovskites show an increase in band gap upon partial
              substitution of the larger formamidinium with the smaller cesium,
              due to octahedral tilting. Perovskites based on tin, which is
              slightly smaller than lead, show the opposite trend: they show no
              octahedral tilting upon Cs-substitution but only a contraction of
              the lattice, leading to progressive reduction of the band gap. We

              17.8\%, showing promise for improvements of the bottom cell of

               understand effective interactions in the eutectic mixture
               formation. It was found that the insertion of glucose molecules
               reduced the accumulation of chloride anions around choline
               cations, eventually decreasing the interaction between the

  abstract = "CO2 is a renewable, abundant and cheap C1-feedstock and its
              conversion to cyclic carbonates starting from epoxides has been
              widely explored in the last years. Nevertheless, conducting this
              reaction under mild and sustainable conditions is still a
              challenging task. Herein we present the use of choline-salt based
              eutectic mixtures as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with
              epoxides to give cyclic carbonates. Choline chloride and choline
              iodide have been coupled with various hydrogen bond donors
              (HBDs), mainly cheap and bio-based carboxylic acids and polyols,
              to form two classes of eutectic mixtures. Very good yields were
              achieved under mild conditions (80 °C in 7--22 h) for various
              terminal epoxides, with both classes of catalysts. While a
              pressure of 0.4 MPa of CO2 is required to obtain appreciable
              conversions using choline chloride-based mixture, atmospheric
              pressure of CO2 (balloon) has been successfully used with choline
              iodide-based mixtures. Furthermore, the catalysts could be
              recycled without appreciable loss of the catalytic activity. The
              improved catalytic performance of both choline-based eutectic
              mixtures is attributed to the synergistic activity of the halide,
              responsible for the opening of the epoxy-ring, and the HBD that
              has a role in the stabilization of the alkoxide intermediate.",

               high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is to employ
               additives as crystallization agents or to passivate defects.
               Tri-iodide ion has been known as an efficient additive to
               improve the crystallinity, grain size, and morphology of
               perovskite films. However, the generation and control of this
               tri-iodide ion are challenging. Herein, an efficient method to
               produce tri-iodide ion in a precursor solution using a
               photoassisted process for application in PSCs is developed.
               Results suggest that the tri-iodide ion can be synthesized
               rapidly when formamidinium iodide (FAI) dissolved isopropyl
               alcohol (IPA) solution is exposed to LED light. Specifically,
               the photoassisted FAI?IPA solution facilitates the formation of

               and low trap density, thereby improving the device performance
               up to 22\%. This study demonstrates that the photoassisted

               issue receiving growing attention. For large-area PSCs, more
               reproducibility is required to precisely control the
               crystallization behavior of perovskites. A two-step process has
               been preferred to apply large-area coatings of perovskite
               because of its better reproducibility, but the process has
               suffered from slow and incomplete conversion of PbI2 to
               perovskite. In this paper, we propose a fast, simple, two-step
               method---mediator extraction treatment (MET)---for the
               preparation of a high-quality perovskite film. In MET, a

               peculiar PbI2 film with a porous morphology and unusual

               without encapsulation, together with the high film quality with

               alternatives to lead-based halide perovskites for photovoltaic
               applications. In particular, Cs2AgBiBr6 has been the subject of
               several studies because of its environmental stability, low
               toxicity, and its promising optoelectronic features. Despite
               these encouraging features, the performances of solar cells
               based on this double perovskite are still low, suggesting severe
               limitations that need to be addressed. In this work we combine
               experimental and theoretical studies to show that the short
               electron diffusion length is one of the major causes for the
               limited performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells. Using EQE
               measurements on semitransparent Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells we
               estimate the electron diffusion length to be only 30 nm and
               corroborated this value by terahertz spectroscopy. By using
               photothermal deflection spectroscopy and surface photovoltage
               measurements we correlate the limited electron diffusion length
               with a high density of electron traps. Our findings highlight
               important faults affecting this double perovskite, showing the

               cubic layered structure analogous to CdCl2 using either powder
               or single crystal X-ray crystallography. In addition, we
               demonstrate the existence a noncubic CdCl2-type polymorph by
               isolation of nontwinned single crystals. The indirect optical
               band gap of AgBiI4 is measured to be 1.63(1) eV, comparable to
               the indirect band gap of 1.69(1) eV measured for BiI3 and

              the pyrometallurgical process that has dominated lead production

              Pb salts into the deep eutectic solvent (DES) Ethaline 200, a
              liquid formed when a 1 : 2 molar ratio of choline chloride and

              typically results in photocurrent losses owing to their saturated
              carbon backbones, hindering charge transport and collection.
              Here, we investigate the use of AAs with varying carbon chain
              lengths as zwitterionic additives to enhance the PSC device
              stability, in air and nitrogen, under illumination. We, however,
              discovered that the device stability is insensitive to the chain
              length as the anticipated photocurrent drops as the chain length
              increases. Using glycine as an additive results in an improvement
              in the open circuit voltage from 1.10 to 1.14 V and a resulting
              power conversion efficiency of 20.2\% (20.1\% stabilized). Using

              the AAs reside at the surfaces and interfaces of our perovskite
              films and propose the mechanisms by which stability is enhanced.
              We highlight this with glycine as an additive, whereby an 8-fold
              increase in the device lifetime in ambient air at 1 sun
              illumination is recorded. Short-circuit photoluminescence
              quenching of complete devices is reported, which reveals that the
              loss in photocurrent density observed with longer carbon chain
              AAs results from the inefficient charge extraction from the

              cm/V1/2. Additionally, by measuring several 1.5 $\mu$m CuSCN

               organic--inorganic halide perovskites poses a challenge for
               their commercialization. Comprehensive understanding of the
               underlying degradation mechanisms is a crucial step to seek
               approaches that can effectively suppress the degradation of
               perovskites. Herein, on the basis of extensive first-principles
               calculations, a three-step photo-oxidative degradation mechanism
               of MAPbI3 at the atomic level is revealed. We find that, in a
               dry ambient environment, the photo-generated superoxide anions
               (O2−) first lead to fast surface oxidation. However, further
               oxidation of the perovskite interior is hindered by the solid
               oxidation product. The fresh water produced in surface oxidation
               leads to the hydration of the inner perovskite and eventual
               breakage of the MAPbI3 lattice. We devise a practical strategy
               for protecting MAPbI3 from photo-induced decomposition by
               anchoring hydrophobic 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine on the
               surface of MAPbI3. The surface modification significantly

               Lead replacement with other less toxic elements is actively
               discussed and intensively investigated in many research
               laboratories over the world. However, the comparative study of
               the toxicity/hazard effects induced by different metal halides
               (Pb, Sn, Bi), as well as organic counterparts of perovskites
               (i.e., methylammonium or formamidinium halides) is still
               missing. Herein, we present the first systematic in vitro and in
               vivo study of the acute toxicity effects of a panel of the
               precursors commonly applied in the fabrication of PSCs.
               Surprisingly, we found that bio-effects of methylammonium iodide
               (MAI) are similar to that of lead iodide (PbI2) in in vitro
               models. Furthermore, tin iodide (SnI2) is just about ten times
               less toxic than PbI2 which makes questionable its potential use
               as ``eco-friendly'' material. In vivo experiments demonstrated
               that MAI and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are three times more
               toxic than PbI2 in terms of the lethal dose 50\% (LD50). Thus,
               the presented here results show that the high acute toxicity
               effects of organic halides were largely overlooked by the
               community in the shadow of the actively discussed lead toxicity.
               Still, the potential mass application of PSCs is not expected to
               cause significant environmental impact or health hazard in
               comparison with other sources of lead pollution associated with

              solar cells (PSCs) is normally lower than that of Pb cells,
              mainly due to greater open circuit voltage (VOC ) losses. Herein,
              the additive 2,6-diaminopyridine (TNPD) is designed to anchor on
              the surface of the perovskite precursor colloid as nucleating
              agent to modulate the growth of Pb-Sn perovskites. It is observed
              that the TNPD not only effectively induces crystal growth during
              the nucleation stage, remaining on the crystal surface and
              ultimately passivating the resulting perovskite films, but also
              releases the micro-strain generated during the film growth.
              Furthermore, TNPD could lower the defect density (Sn4+ amount) by
              screening the perovskite against oxygen and by synergistically
              bonding with undercoordinated Sn/Pb on the surface. Finally, a

               photodetectors with an optimal SnF2 concentration of 20\%
               exhibit a fast response speed of 0.56 ms and an excellent
               specific detectivity of 6.32 $\times$ 1013 Jones, the best
               combination of THP-based photodetectors reported hitherto. The
               SnF2 additive is found to suppress the formation of Sn vacancies
               and improve the crystallinity of PEA2SnI4 films. The work
               provides an air-processing technology of Pb-free perovskite,

               offering an effective way to demonstrate high performance

               promising alternatives for high performance lead-free perovskite
               solar cells. However, the character of Sn2+ is easily oxidized
               to Sn4+, causing unnecessary p-type self-doping and high leakage
               current. More seriously, trap-induced non-radiative
               recombination from rapid crystallization causes into large
               energy loss with a low open circuit voltage. Therefore, the
               Sn-based solar cells have efficiency far behind the Pb-based
               solar cells. Herein, the polymer poly(ethylene glycol)
               diacrylate (PEGDA) is used to control crystal growth and
               passivate the defects in FA0.85PEA0.15SnI3 thin film. This

               an enhanced stability due to PEGDA induced compressive strain in

              potential in both single-junction and all-perovskite tandem solar
              cells. Sn-Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by
              low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, a
              ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl is reported as the hole-transport
              material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95 eV for Sn-Pb PSCs.
              The solution-processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that
              not only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also
              changes grain growth of Sn-Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier
              diffusion length to 3.63 µm. The formation of small perovskite
              grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These
              result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of
              96 $\pm$ 2\% across the absorption spectrum of Sn-Pb perovskites.
              The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn-Pb PSCs
              with 87\% of its initial efficiency retained after 1-sun
              illumination for 1200 h, and keeps 85\% efficiency under 85 °C
              thermal stress for 1500 h. The hybrid HTM further improves the

              exclusively employed organic hole conducting polymers which are

              open-circuit voltage, compared to the best spiro-OMeTAD devices,

              typically results in photocurrent losses owing to their saturated
              carbon backbones, hindering charge transport and collection.
              Here, we investigate the use of AAs with varying carbon chain
              lengths as zwitterionic additives to enhance the PSC device
              stability, in air and nitrogen, under illumination. We, however,
              discovered that the device stability is insensitive to the chain

              increases. Using glycine as an additive results in an improvement
              in the open circuit voltage from 1.10 to 1.14 V and a resulting
              power conversion efficiency of 20.2\% (20.1\% stabilized). Using

              We highlight this with glycine as an additive, whereby an 8-fold
              increase in the device lifetime in ambient air at 1 sun
              illumination is recorded. Short-circuit photoluminescence
              quenching of complete devices is reported, which reveals that the
              loss in photocurrent density observed with longer carbon chain
              AAs results from the inefficient charge extraction from the

               have recently drawn enormous attentions due to their impressive
               performance (>22\%) and low temperature solution processability
               (<150 °C). Current solution process involves application of a
               large amount of toxic solvents, such as chlorobenzene, which is
               heavily employed in both the perovskite layer and the hole
               transport layer (HTL) deposition. Herein, this study employs
               green solvent of ethyl acetate for engineering efficient
               perovskite and HTL layers, which enables a synergic interface
               (perovskite/HTL) optimization. A champion efficiency of 19.43\%
               is obtained for small cells (0.16 cm2 with mask) and over 14\%
               for large size modules (5 $\times$ 5 cm2). The PSCs prepared
               from the green solvent engineering demonstrate superior
               performance on both efficiency and stability over their
               chlorobenzene counterparts. These enhancements are ascribed to
               the in situ inhibition on carrier recombination induced by
               interfacial defects during the solution processing, which
               enables about 2/3 reduction of calculated recombination rate.

               However, little is known about the chemical transformations that
               occur in the initial stages of perovskite crystal formation.
               Here we follow the real-time formation dynamics of MAPbI3 from a
               bilayer of lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI)
               deposited through a two-step thermal evaporation process. By
               lowering the substrate temperature during deposition, we are
               able to initially inhibit intermixing of the two layers. We
               subsequently use infrared and visible light transmission, X-ray
               diffraction, and photoluminescence lifetime measurements to
               reveal the room-temperature transformations that occur in vacuum
               and ambient air, as MAI diffuses into the PbI2 lattice to form
               MAPbI3. In vacuum, the transformation to MAPbI3 is incomplete as
               unreacted MAI is retained in the film. However, exposure to
               moist air allows for conversion of the unreacted MAI to MAPbI3,
               demonstrating that moisture is essential in making MAI more
               mobile and thus aiding perovskite crystallization. These dynamic
               processes are reflected in the observed charge-carrier

              Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a
              coherent interface could be formed between the
              electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the
              formation of an interlayer between a SnO2 electron-transporting
              layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by
              coupling Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite
              precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features,
              which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite
              layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a
              coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar
              cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent
              (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination.
              Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent
              of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure
              for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing
              defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and
              electron-transporting layers.",

              synthesized through several methods. The ease of fabrication has
              favored the adoption of lab-scale solution-processing techniques,
              which have yielded the highest performing devices. Most of these

              and volume preparations, hindering the consolidation and market

              technology widely adopted in the coating and semiconductor

              presents a low-cost, vacuum-free fabrication method for this
              novel TE; the approach combines lithography, electroplating, and
              imprint transfer (LEIT) processing. The embedded nature of the
              EMTEs offers many advantages, such as high surface smoothness,
              which is essential for organic electronic device production;
              superior mechanical stability during bending; favorable
              resistance to chemicals and moisture; and strong adhesion with

              for vacuum-free metal deposition and is favorable for industrial

              metal mesh with a high aspect ratio (i.e., thickness to

               performance at the phase transition temperature of MAPbI3. In

               widely to this end. Despite the versatility of the solution
               approach, device fabrication using typical ``top-down''
               lithography is generally incompatible with as-prepared OIHPs
               films because of the low stability of perovskites to polar
               solvents involved in the lithographic process. Moreover,
               solution-prepared perovskites usually exhibit irregular surface
               roughness, implying the existence of randomly oriented crystal
               domains with a large density of grain boundaries, which are
               ultimately detrimental to the material properties. Here, we
               report a patterning of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films using a
               photolithographically fabricated cross-linked copolymer template
               on Si or SiO2 substrates via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)

               subsequently converting to MAPbI3 using CH3NH3I (MAI) in the

               For third-generation solar cells of organolead halide
               perovskites, the monofacial power conversion efficiency (PCE)
               has exceeded 23\%. Therefore, the development of efficient
               bifacial cells is expected, but the top transparent electrode is
               a crucial obstacle that must be overcome. In this work,
               ultrathin silver (Ag) film was selected as the top transparent
               electrode and, particularly, a tellurium oxide (TeO2) optical
               coupling layer was adopted to enhance the transmittance of the
               Ag film in the visible light region, which markedly increased
               the light absorption of devices. Compared with PSCs with a pure
               Ag electrode, the device with a TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) top
               electrode showed significantly enhanced bifacial short-circuit
               current-density and bifacial PCEs of 18.86\% (illuminated from
               the ITO electrode) and 15.12\% (illuminated from the Ag
               electrode). Consequently, in addition to its role as a
               transmittance enhancement layer, TeO2 acted as a back reflector
               when the device was illuminated from the ITO side. Furthermore,
               a previously proposed phenylethylammonium iodide treatment
               method was adopted to improve charge transport at the
               perovskite/fullerene interface. Remarkably, the device achieved
               champion bifacial PCEs of 20.96\% (ITO side) and 17.36\% (Ag
               side), a bifaciality factor of 82.82\%, and a steady PCE output
               and good reproducibility. The large-area device (1 cm2) achieved
               bifacial PCEs of 12.42\% (ITO side) and 10.55\% (Ag side), with
               better performance predicted by simulations. Therefore, the
               TeO2/Ag films are promising transparent electrodes for

               visualization technique was applied to observe the coating bead,

               upstream menisci, just before and after coating defects appear
               at high coating speeds. Special features of coating bead shapes,

               experimentally for the onset of coating defects were used to
               judge whether the coating flow was within the operating window.
               The theoretically evaluated operating windows were found to be
               much larger than those determined experimentally in terms of

  abstract = "Halide perovskites perform remarkably in optoelectronic devices.
              However, this exceptional performance is striking given that
              perovskites exhibit deep charge-carrier traps and spatial
              compositional and structural heterogeneity, all of which should
              be detrimental to performance. Here, we resolve this
              long-standing paradox by providing a global visualization of the
              nanoscale chemical, structural and optoelectronic landscape in
              halide perovskite devices, made possible through the development
              of a new suite of correlative, multimodal microscopy measurements
              combining quantitative optical spectroscopic techniques and
              synchrotron nanoprobe measurements. We show that compositional
              disorder dominates the optoelectronic response over a weaker
              influence of nanoscale strain variations even of large magnitude.
              Nanoscale compositional gradients drive carrier funnelling onto
              local regions associated with low electronic disorder, drawing
              carrier recombination away from trap clusters associated with
              electronic disorder and leading to high local photoluminescence
              quantum efficiency. These measurements reveal a global picture of
              the competitive nanoscale landscape, which endows enhanced defect
              tolerance in devices through spatial chemical disorder that
              outcompetes both electronic and structural disorder.",

              perovskite materials are strongly dependent on the film

              an Arrhenius-type law. The predictive role is played by the
              activation energy combined with its pre-exponential factor. Our
              comparative study under moisture conditions with respect to
              vacuum and nitrogen treatments has assessed the occurrence of an
              intrinsic dynamic exchange of protons between the organic cations
              and the inorganic cage with a direct impact on the lattice
              stability, for which the presence of water molecules is not
              mandatory. This mutual interaction produces defects inside the
              material and volatile species, such as HI, CH3NH2 or MAI, with an
              associated experimental activation energy of 1.54 eV measured

              demonstrate that the substitution of methylammonium (MA(+)) with
              the formamidinium (FA(+)) cations inside the inorganic cage gives
              greater robustness to the overall lattice and extends the

              to sulfurize MoDTC in solution in a hydrocarbon base oil could be
              demonstrated. Sulfurized Mo complexes bearing one or two
              additional sulfur atoms (1S-MoDTC and 2S-MoDTC, respectively)

              lubricants as compared to the ``classical'' MoDTC. Therefore,

               functional, passivating, and encapsulating layers on top of
               halide perovskites. Studies in that area have only focused on
               metal oxides, despite a great number of materials that can be
               made with ALD. This work demonstrates that, in addition to
               oxides, other ALD processes can be compatible with the
               perovskites. We describe two new ALD processes for lead sulfide.
               These processes operate at low deposition temperatures (45--155
               °C) that have been inaccessible to previous ALD PbS processes.
               Our processes rely on volatile and reactive lead precursors
               Pb(dbda) (dbda = rac-N2,N3-di-tert-butylbutane-2,3-diamide) and
               Pb(btsa)2 (btsa = bis(trimethylsilyl)amide) as well as H2S.
               These precursors produce high quality PbS thin films that are
               uniform, crystalline, and pure. The films exhibit p-type
               conductivity and good mobilities of 10--70 cm2 V--1 s--1. Low
               deposition temperatures enable direct ALD of PbS onto a halide
               perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) without its decomposition. The
               stability of MAPI in ambient air is greatly improved by capping
               with ALD PbS. More generally, these new processes offer valuable
               alternatives for PbS-based devices, and we hope that this study
               will inspire more studies on ALD of non-oxides on halide
               perovskites.",

               For this technology to be deployed on a large scale, the two

              promising prospects for practical applications due to their
              simple fabrication process, low material cost and high stability.
              The device is based on a mesoporous triple-layer scaffold, and
              the perovskite is deposited in the scaffold as a light absorber.
              Various solvents have been employed to prepare the perovskite
              precursors. However, the coordination between lead halides and
              the solvent molecules may lead to the formation of precipitates
              after a period of storage. The precipitates significantly
              influence the stoichiometric compositions of the precursors, and
              result in undesired variations in the device performance. Herein,
              we introduce ethanol (EtOH) into a typical $\gamma$-butyrolactone
              (GBL) based perovskite precursor. The addition of EtOH not only
              weaken the coordination between Pb and solvent molecules, but
              also facilitate the crystallization of the perovskite absorber.
              Besides, the EtOH modified precursor shows improved wettability
              on the mesoporous scaffold, spreading and penetrating more
              efficiently than typical precursor. Correspondingly, highly
              reproducible device performance with an average power conversion
              efficiency (PCE) of 14.95\% and best PCE of 15.11\% are achieved.
              This work makes it possible to stabilize the perovskite
              precursors for a long-term period, and will significantly benefit
              the potential mass-production of this emerging photovoltaic

              layer based on 4-Fluoro-Phenethylammonium iodide (4FPEAI) was
              successfully fabricated to improve the humidity resistance and

              enhanced lattice anharmonicity in the segregated I-rich domains,

  abstract  = "Abstract Efficient mixed metal lead-tin halide perovskites are
               essential for the development of all-perovskite tandem solar
               cells, however they are currently limited by significant
               short-circuit current losses despite their near optimal bandgap
               ($\approx$1.25 eV). Herein, the origin of these losses is
               investigated, using a combination of voltage dependent
               photoluminescence (PL) timeseries and various charge extraction
               measurements. It is demonstrated that the Pb/Sn-perovskite
               devices suffer from a reduction in the charge extraction
               efficiency within the first few seconds of operation, which
               leads to a loss in current and lower maximum power output. In
               addition, the emitted PL from the device rises on the exact same
               timescales due to the accumulation of electronic charges in the
               active layer. Using transient charge extraction measurements, it
               is shown that these observations cannot be explained by
               doping-induced electronic charges but by the movement of mobile
               ions toward the perovskite/transport layer interfaces, which
               inhibits charge extraction due to band flattening. Finally,
               these findings are generalized to lead-based perovskites,
               showing that the loss mechanism is universal. This elucidates
               the negative role mobile ions play in perovskite solar cells and
               paves a path toward understanding and mitigating a key loss
               mechanism.",

               investigated across five compositions along the AgBiI4?CuI solid
               solution line (stoichiometry Cu4x(AgBi)1?xI4). The presence of a
               close-packed iodide sublattice is found to provide a good
               backbone for general semiconducting properties across all of
               these materials, whose optoelectronic properties are found to
               improve markedly with increasing copper content, which enhances

               photoconductivity measurements reveal that this enhanced

               on hybrid lead--halide perovskites for photovoltaics owing to
               rapid improvements in efficiency. The advent of these materials
               for solar applications has led to widespread interest in
               understanding the key enabling properties of these materials.
               This has resulted in renewed interest in related compounds and a
               search for materials that may replicate the defect-tolerant
               properties and long lifetimes of the hybrid lead-halide
               perovskites. Given the rapid pace of development of the field,
               the rises in efficiencies of these systems have outpaced the
               more basic understanding of these materials. Measuring or
               calculating the basic properties, such as crystal/electronic
               structure and composition, can be challenging because some of
               these materials have anisotropic structures, and/or are composed
               of both heavy metal cations and volatile, mobile, light
               elements. Some consequences are beam damage during
               characterization, composition change under vacuum, or compound
               effects, such as the alteration of the electronic structure
               through the influence of the substrate. These effects make it
               challenging to understand the basic properties integral to
               optoelectronic operation. Compounding these difficulties is the
               rapid pace with which the field progresses. This has created an
               ongoing need to continually evaluate best practices with respect
               to characterization and calculations, as well as to identify
               inconsistencies in reported values to determine if those
               inconsistencies are rooted in characterization methodology or
               materials synthesis. This article describes the difficulties in
               characterizing hybrid lead--halide perovskites and new materials
               and how these challenges may be overcome. The topic was
               discussed at a seminar at the 2015 Materials Research Society
               Fall Meeting \& Exhibit. This article highlights the lessons
               learned from the seminar and the insights of some of the
               attendees, with reference to both recent literature and
               controlled experiments to illustrate the challenges discussed.
               The focus in this article is on crystallography, composition
               measurements, photoemission spectroscopy, and calculations on
               perovskites and new, related absorbers. We suggest how the
               reporting of the important artifacts could be streamlined

               now show power conversion efficiency of up to 22\%. However,
               these cells are facing issues towards commercialization, such as
               the need to achieve long-term stability and the development of a
               manufacturing method for the reproducible fabrication of
               high-performance devices. Here, we propose a strategy to obtain
               stable and commercially viable perovskite solar cells. A
               reproducible manufacturing method is suggested, as well as
               routes to manage grain boundaries and interfacial charge

               theoretical efficiency. We highlight how optimizing the design
               of device architectures is important not only for achieving high
               efficiency but also for hysteresis-free and stable performance.
               We argue that reliable device characterization is needed to
               ensure the advance of this technology towards practical
               applications. We believe that perovskite-based devices can be
               competitive with silicon solar modules, and discuss issues

               limitations that exist when analyzing human blood and urine

               production and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear
               cells. Lead activates the secretion of the chemokine IL-8 and
               impacts mitogen-dependent activation by increasing the secretion
               of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ and of
               the chemokines IL-8 and MIP1-$\alpha$ in the presence of
               phytohemagglutinin. The recorded changes in gene expression
               affected major cellular functions, including metallothionein
               expression, and the expression of cellular metabolic enzymes and
               protein kinase activity. The expression of 31 genes remained
               elevated after the removal of lead from the testing medium

               number of transcripts which encode cellular metabolic enzymes.
               Cellular responses to lead correlated with blood lead levels and

               individuals with elevated zinc protoporphyrin blood levels and
               found that genes regulating the transmission of nerve impulses

               G-protein mediated signaling, gap junction signaling, synaptic

  abstract  = "Crystalline silicon dominates the solar panel industry today but
               remains relatively expensive to manufacture. If devices could be
               fabricated from inexpensive materials by a simple solution
               process without the need for high-temperature annealing, their
               cost could be considerably reduced. Recently, inorganic--organic
               (I/O) hybrid systems based on inorganic nanoparticles (including
               quantum dots) and perovskite materials as light harvesters with
               organic hole-conducting materials have shown great potential for
               efficient solar cells due to the combination of superior optical

               been many approaches taken to the deposition of this material,
               one-step spin-coating remains the simplest and most widely used
               method in research laboratories. Although spin-coating is not
               recognised as the ideal manufacturing methodology, it represents
               a starting point from which more scalable deposition methods,
               such as slot-dye coating or ink-jet printing can be developed.
               Here, we introduce a new, low-boiling point, low viscosity
               solvent system that enables rapid, room temperature
               crystallisation of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite
               films, without the use of strongly coordinating aprotic
               solvents. Through the use of this solvent, we produce dense,
               pinhole free films with uniform coverage, high specularity, and
               enhanced optoelectronic properties. We fabricate devices and
               achieve stabilised power conversion efficiencies of over 18\%

               coating on substrate areas of up to 125 cm2, showing tremendous
               promise for the fabrication of large area, high efficiency,
               solution processed devices, and represents a critical step

               Conventionally high efficiency perovskite solar cells are formed

               Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) films can be made from a

              the photovoltaic performance. Here, we report on micro-wrinkled
              perovskite layers to enhance photocarrier transport performances.
              By utilizing temperature-dependent miscibility of dimethyl
              sulfoxide with diethyl ether, the geometry of the microscopic
              wrinkles of the perovskite films are controlled. Wrinkling is
              pronounced as temperature of diethyl ether (TDE) decreases due to
              the compressive stress relaxation of the thin rigid film-capped
              viscoelastic layer. Time-correlated single-photon counting
              reveals longer carrier lifetime at the hill sites than at the
              valley sites. The wrinkled morphology formed at TDE = 5 °C shows
              higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability
              than the flat one formed at TDE = 30 °C. Interfacial and additive

               we investigated the effects of a series of green

               diisopropyl ether (DIE), and dibutyl ether---on the

               antisolvent's polarity, it was possible to form a pure

               intermediate phase led us to identify DIE as a green antisolvent

               18.51\%. Furthermore, the repeatability of these champion PCEs
               was greatly improved. This work contributes to the understanding

  abstract  = "Metal halide perovskite-based solar cells have attracted
               considerable attention in recent years owing to their
               inexpensive and easy fabrication and rapidly increasing
               efficiencies, which already match those of the industrially
               dominant multi-crystalline silicon. The incorporation of
               perovskite absorber materials into multiple (multi-)junction
               cells could potentially allow us to go well beyond silicon-based
               technology and reach even higher power conversion efficiencies.
               Layering multiple solar-absorber junctions on top of each other
               enables the absorption of different regions of the solar
               spectrum, so that more energy can be extracted from sunlight.
               The possibility of tuning the bandgap of perovskite materials
               over a wide range, along with the ability to generate high
               open-circuit voltages from wide-bandgap absorbers, make
               perovskites ideal candidates. Perovskites can be used in
               combination with or as a substitute for silicon in photovoltaic
               technologies already in use and can be assembled in hybrid
               tandem architectures or layered in all-perovskite multi-junction
               cells. In this Review, we discuss opportunities for perovskite
               multi-junction cells, explore the progress made so far, describe
               the theoretical possibilities and discuss perspectives and
               challenges for the future of this emergent technology. The
               tunable bandgap of perovskites and their combination in
               multi-junction solar cells can afford highly efficient
               photovoltaic technologies. This Review reports the latest
               developments in tandem multi-junction perovskite solar cells and
               discusses prospects for this technology to achieve energy

              co-evaporation of precursors is a method that results in very
              smooth and pinhole-free perovskite thin films and allows
              excellent control over film thickness and composition. However,
              for a deposition method to become industrially scalable,
              reproducible process control and high device yields are
              essential. Unfortunately, to date, the control and
              reproducibility of evaporating organic precursors such as
              methylammonium iodide (MAI) have proved extremely challenging. We
              show that the established method of controlling the evaporation
              rate of MAI with quartz microbalances (QMBs) is critically
              sensitive to the concentration of the impurities MAH2PO3 and
              MAH2PO2 that are usually present in MAI after synthesis.
              Therefore, controlling the deposition rate of MAI with QMBs is
              unreliable since the concentration of such impurities typically
              varies from one batch of MAI to another and even during the
              course of a deposition. However once reliable control of MAI
              deposition is achieved, we find that the presence of precursor
              impurities during perovskite deposition does not degrade the
              solar cell performance. Our results indicate that as long as
              precursor deposition rates are well controlled, physical vapor
              deposition will allow high solar cell device yields even if the
              purity of precursors changes from one run to another.",

               dissolve the perovskite precursor materials prior to the
               perovskite formation. Previously, efforts have been made to
               exchange the said solvents for water with some success. Herein,
               we build on that work to develop a procedure for synthesising
               perovskite absorbers using only water and isopropanol as
               solvents. Our technique can be utilised for fabricating many
               different perovskite compositions, organic and inorganic. The
               technique is based on the high solubility of metal nitrates,
               such as lead(II) nitrate and caesium(I) nitrate, in water and,
               respectively, their poor solubilities in isopropanol. The
               inclusion of CsNO3 to Pb(NO3)2 films does not result in a phase

  abstract  = "ConspectusPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have, in recent years,
               become one of the most in-depth photovoltaic materials in many
               different disciplines due to their long-range charge carrier
               diffusion lengths, strong light absorption, easy tuning of the
               band gaps, low defect density, and solution processability. The
               power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has
               reached a certified value of 25.5\%, which has caught up with or
               even surpassed traditional photovoltaic technologies, such as
               silicon (Si) solar cells, thin film solar cell, etc. In addition
               to the performance of PSCs comparable to traditional
               photovoltaic technology, its biggest feature is that it can be
               prepared by a solution method. The preparation process of the
               solution method simplify the film preparation process and
               greatly reduce the preparation cost. In addition, the solution
               method provides a favorable option for the energy supply of
               flexible wearable devices in the future.At present, the
               preparation of PSCs mainly uses organic molecular solvents,
               including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide
               (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and their mixed solvents.
               However, most of these commonly used organic solvents are unsafe
               and are likely to cause water and soil pollution, harm to the
               human body, and safety accidents. In addition, most solvents
               have a high coordination number, which limits the
               crystallization of perovskite. Furthermore, high-quality
               perovskite films require the introduction of a large amount of
               high boiling point, polar and aprotic antisolvents to assist
               crystallization, such as chlorobenzene, ether, and ethyl
               acetate. In addition to the toxicological problems of the
               antisolvent, the technology has a relatively narrow operating
               time window, relatively high operating environment requirements,
               and relatively low repeatability, which greatly limits the
               large-scale production of PSCs. Therefore, It is very necessary
               to develop a new solvent engineering technology for PSCs, which
               is green and pollution-free, is a simple process, and has high
               efficiency, long-term stability, and low cost. Recently, we have
               developed a series of ionic liquids, including MAAc, MAFa, BAAc,
               etc., which can be used as solvents to prepare efficient and
               stable PSCs. It allows the production of smooth and continuous
               polycrystalline perovskite thin films in ambient air through a
               simple spin coating methodIn this Account, we started with the
               discovery of ionic liquids as solvents to PSCs. We have proposed
               new strategies for improving and enhancing ionic liquid-based
               PSCs, including interface engineering, solvent engineering, and
               additive engineering. Furthermore, the stable and efficient
               mechanism of ionic liquid-based perovskite solar cells has been
               revealed. In view of the designable characteristics of ionic
               liquids, some functional ionic liquids have been designed and
               applied to different systems of halide perovskites, which has
               important guiding significance for the development of more
               functional ionic liquids for PSCs. Finally, the challenges and
               future directions of ionic liquid-based PSCs from both
               large-scale production and technological perspectives are
               proposed to provide a new method for the commercialization of

               remain to be addressed by the research community, using hole
               transporting materials (HTMs) such as
               2,2?,7,7?-tetrakis(N,N?-di-pmethoxyphenylamino)-9,9?-spirbiuorene(Spiro-OMeTAD)
               and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA). HTMs
               are essential for high-performance PSC devices. Although
               effective, these materials require a relatively high degree of
               doping with additives to improve charge mobility and
               interlayer/substrate compatibility, introducing doping-induced

               electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. Nonradiative losses in such

               toward the Shockley--Queisser limit. In this work, we analyze
               and quantify the radiative limit of Voc in a perovskite solar

              Subsequently, PbS films were chemically converted to PbI2 and

              homeotropic alignment could not be obtained by annealing.
              However, a degree of rectification higher than 3 orders of

              structures and growth, which are intimately correlated for
              improvements of not only solar cells but also light-emitting
              diodes, lasers, and photodetectors. We begin with the survey of
              the film formation process of perovskites including deposition
              methods and morphological optimization avenues. Strategies such
              as the use of additives, thermal annealing, solvent annealing,
              atmospheric control, and solvent engineering have been
              successfully employed to yield high-quality perovskite films.
              Next, we turn to summarize the shape evolution of perovskites
              single crystals from three-dimensional large sized single
              crystals, two-dimensional nanoplates, one-dimensional nanowires,
              to zero-dimensional quantum dots. Siginificant functions of
              perovskites single crystals are highlighted, which benefit
              fundamental studies of intrinsic photophysics. Then, the growth
              mechanisms of the previously mentioned perovskite crystals are
              unveiled. Lastly, perspectives for structure and growth control
              of perovskites are outlined towards high-performance
              (opto)electronic devices.",

               in the literature studying the properties of these unique
               materials. While the highest performance and best progress have
               been observed with methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites,
               their low tolerance to moisture and rapid degradation when
               exposed to UV light and high temperatures have posed a major

               hybrid perovskites (MHHPs) where I− is substituted with Br− and
               Cl− have driven a paradigm shift in PSCs, synergistically
               combining high performance with high ambient stability. In this
               comprehensive review, we summarize the progress made in the past
               5 years in methylammonium-based organic--inorganic MHHPs and
               cesium-based all inorganic MHHPs. We discuss the fabrication

               performance. Unique from other reviews, we focus this review on
               the optical properties of MHHPs, including light-induced phase
               segregation and alterations in the optical band gap and
               photoluminescence with halide substitution. We also summarize
               trends in carrier dynamics, including carrier thermalization,

               substituted with formamidinium/cesium or Pb is substituted with
               less toxic and benign metals to improve both the stability and

               The emission colour is directly tuned by modifying the halide

               solar cells is also being discussed, which suggests alternative
               market entry. Although intensive investigations are being made
               on their technical feasibility, serious analysis on the cost of
               perovskite-based tandem modules is lacking. The levelized cost
               of electricity (LCOE) of solar modules is often used to evaluate
               technoeconomic competitiveness. Here, we performed a detailed
               cost analysis on two perovskite-based tandem modules (the
               perovskite/c-silicon and the perovskite/perovskite tandem
               module) compared with standard multi-crystalline silicon and
               single-junction perovskite solar cells. We found that perovskite
               PVs (both single junction and multi-junction) are competitive in
               the context of LCOE if the module lifetime is comparable with
               that of c-silicon solar cells. This encourages further efforts
               to push perovskite tandem modules onto the market in the future.",

               modules is presented, outlining the most viable pathway for
               designing cost-effective, commercially viable tandems. We
               explore the cost-performance trade-off for silicon bottom cells
               in perovskite-silicon tandems, and evaluate the potential of
               using low-cost, lower-efficiency silicon bottom cells, on the
               basis of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), compared to the
               higher-efficiency, higher-cost bottom cells that have been the
               primary focus of most perovskite-silicon tandem research
               efforts. We fabricate a cost-effective four-terminal
               silicon-perovskite tandem using a low-cost multicrystalline
               bottom cell and calculate the device LCOE. We then extend this
               analysis by modeling performance and LCOE of similar tandems
               instead using high-efficiency silicon bottom cells, enabling
               direct comparison of a low-cost and a high-efficiency tandem.
               Lastly parametric analyses are performed to more broadly examine
               the bottom-cell cost-performance trade-off. We show that
               low-cost silicon, even at the detriment of efficiency, is the
               more likely path to make perovskite-silicon tandems commercially
               viable and enable future reductions in LCOE, given both current
               and near-future silicon technology. We lay out a clear economic
               motivation for pursuing low-cost silicon bottom cells in
               perovskite-silicon tandems, showing that they can achieve a
               15--20\% relative LCOE reduction compared to the single-junction
               sub-cells. This is a 2--3 times greater relative LCOE reduction
               compared with using high-efficiency silicon. Furthermore, we
               show that the advantage of using low-cost silicon bottom cells
               is robust to and benefits from expected market trends, such as
               falling system costs and advanced, low-cost manufacturing. This
               work provides a clear pathway to cost-effective tandems,
               outlines the benefits for existing multicrystalline silicon

              solar cells normally occurs by heating the underlying substrate.
              Conversion tends to occur near the top of the film, where solvent
              is lost, and unwanted preheating of reactants occurs near the
              substrate before the reaction. Li et al. show that the use of a
              surrounding heat transfer oil (anisole) leads to more rapid and
              even heating, removes solvent, and avoids air and water
              contamination effects. The larger grains and more uniform films
              led a much greater retention of efficiency in moving from
              small-area to large-area devices. ---PDS Liquid medium annealing
              creates a robust microenvironment and constant heat field to
              fabricate durable perovskite solar cells. Solution processing of
              semiconductors is highly promising for the high-throughput
              production of cost-effective electronics and optoelectronics.
              Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device
              applications, challenges remain in the development of
              high-quality materials with simultaneously improved processing
              reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium
              annealing (LMA) technology that creates a robust chemical
              environment and constant heating field to modulate crystal growth
              over the entire film. Our method produces films with high
              crystallinity, fewer defects, desired stoichiometry, and overall
              film homogeneity. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
              yield a stabilized power output of 24.04\% (certified 23.7\%,
              0.08 cm2) and maintain 95\% of their initial power conversion
              efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of operation. In addition, the
              1-cm2 PSCs exhibit a stabilized power output of 23.15\%
              (certified PCE 22.3\%) and keep 90\% of their initial PCE after
              1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their feasibility for
              scalable fabrication. LMA is less climate dependent and produces
              devices in-house with negligible performance variance year round.
              This method thus opens a new and effective avenue to improving
              the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a

  abstract  = "The spontaneous $\alpha$-to-$\delta$ phase transition of the
               formamidinium-based (FA) lead halide perovskite hinders its
               large scale application in solar cells. Though this phase
               transition can be inhibited by alloying with
               methylammonium-based (MA) perovskite, the underlying mechanism
               is largely unexplored. In this Communication, we grow
               high-quality mixed cations and halides perovskite single
               crystals (FAPbI3)1--x(MAPbBr3)x to understand the principles for
               maintaining pure perovskite phase, which is essential to device
               optimization. We demonstrate that the best composition for a
               perfect $\alpha$-phase perovskite without segregation is x =
               0.1--0.15, and such a mixed perovskite exhibits carrier lifetime
               as long as 11.0 $\mu$s, which is over 20 times of that of FAPbI3
               single crystal. Powder XRD, single crystal XRD and FT-IR results
               reveal that the incorporation of MA+ is critical for tuning the
               effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor toward the ideal value of
               1 and lowering the Gibbs free energy via unit cell contraction
               and cation disorder. Moreover, we find that Br incorporation can
               effectively control the perovskite crystallization kinetics and
               reduce defect density to acquire high-quality single crystals
               with significant inhibition of $\delta$-phase. These findings
               benefit the understanding of $\alpha$-phase stabilization
               behavior, and have led to fabrication of perovskite solar cells
               with highest efficiency of 19.9\% via solvent management.",

               on hybrid lead--halide perovskites for photovoltaics owing to
               rapid improvements in efficiency. The advent of these materials
               for solar applications has led to widespread interest in
               understanding the key enabling properties of these materials.
               This has resulted in renewed interest in related compounds and a
               search for materials that may replicate the defect-tolerant
               properties and long lifetimes of the hybrid lead-halide
               perovskites. Given the rapid pace of development of the field,
               the rises in efficiencies of these systems have outpaced the
               more basic understanding of these materials. Measuring or
               calculating the basic properties, such as crystal/electronic
               structure and composition, can be challenging because some of
               these materials have anisotropic structures, and/or are composed
               of both heavy metal cations and volatile, mobile, light
               elements. Some consequences are beam damage during
               characterization, composition change under vacuum, or compound
               effects, such as the alteration of the electronic structure
               through the influence of the substrate. These effects make it
               challenging to understand the basic properties integral to
               optoelectronic operation. Compounding these difficulties is the
               rapid pace with which the field progresses. This has created an
               ongoing need to continually evaluate best practices with respect
               to characterization and calculations, as well as to identify
               inconsistencies in reported values to determine if those
               inconsistencies are rooted in characterization methodology or
               materials synthesis. This article describes the difficulties in
               characterizing hybrid lead--halide perovskites and new materials
               and how these challenges may be overcome. The topic was
               discussed at a seminar at the 2015 Materials Research Society
               Fall Meeting \& Exhibit. This article highlights the lessons
               learned from the seminar and the insights of some of the
               attendees, with reference to both recent literature and
               controlled experiments to illustrate the challenges discussed.
               The focus in this article is on crystallography, composition
               measurements, photoemission spectroscopy, and calculations on
               perovskites and new, related absorbers. We suggest how the

               their unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiency.
               However, concerns over the potential environmental impact of
               CH3NH3PbI3 are stimulating experimental and theoretical searches
               for the replacement of lead by nontoxic elements. In this study
               we explore all homovalent metal ions which could substitute lead
               in a perovskite halide configuration by performing a systematic
               combinatorial search over the entire periodic table. Our
               screening process selects compounds based on two concurrent
               criteria: the stability of the compound in a perovskite
               structure and the band gap. Using these search criteria, we are
               able to reduce the number of possible compounds from 248 to 25,
               including 15 compounds which have not yet been proposed as
               semiconductors for optoelectronics. We identify Mg as a
               potential candidate for partial replacement of Pb and show that

              mantle, and synthetic crystals are ubiquitous in electronics,
              photonics, and energy technology. The extraordinary chemical
              diversity of these crystals raises the question of how many and
              which perovskites are yet to be discovered. Here we show that the
              ``no-rattling'' principle postulated by Goldschmidt in 1926,
              describing the geometric conditions under which a perovskite can
              form, is much more effective than previously thought and allows
              us to predict perovskites with a fidelity of 80\%. By
              supplementing this principle with inferential statistics and
              internet data mining we establish that currently known
              perovskites are only the tip of the iceberg, and we enumerate
              90,000 hitherto-unknown compounds awaiting to be studied. Our
              results suggest that geometric blueprints may enable the
              systematic screening of millions of compounds and offer untapped

               containing the lead-halide perovskite absorbers RPbX3 (R =

               concern for the large-scale implementation of this technology.
               This has spurred the search for lead-free materials with similar
               optoelectronic properties. Here, we use the double-perovskite
               structure to incorporate nontoxic Bi3+ into the perovskite
               lattice in Cs2AgBiBr6 (1). The solid shows a long
               room-temperature fundamental photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of
               ca. 660 ns, which is very encouraging for photovoltaic
               applications. Comparison between single-crystal and powder PL
               decay curves of 1 suggests inherently high defect tolerance. The
               material has an indirect bandgap of 1.95 eV, suited for a tandem
               solar cell. Furthermore, 1 is significantly more heat and
               moisture stable compared to (MA)PbI3. The extremely promising

  abstract  = "Improving the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells is
               critical to the deployment of this technology. Despite the great
               emphasis laid on stability-related investigations, publications
               lack consistency in experimental procedures and parameters
               reported. It is therefore challenging to reproduce and compare
               results and thereby develop a deep understanding of degradation
               mechanisms. Here, we report a consensus between researchers in
               the field on procedures for testing perovskite solar cell
               stability, which are based on the International Summit on
               Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols. We propose
               additional procedures to account for properties specific to PSCs
               such as ion redistribution under electric fields, reversible
               degradation and to distinguish ambient-induced degradation from
               other stress factors. These protocols are not intended as a
               replacement of the existing qualification standards, but rather
               they aim to unify the stability assessment and to understand
               failure modes. Finally, we identify key procedural information
               which we suggest reporting in publications to improve
               reproducibility and enable large data set analysis. Reliability
               of stability data for perovskite solar cells is undermined by a
               lack of consistency in the test conditions and reporting. This

              light-emitting applications because they exhibit bright,
              bandgap-tunable luminescence with high colour purity1,2.
              Photoluminescence quantum yields close to unity have been
              achieved for perovskite nanocrystals across a broad range of
              emission colours, and light-emitting diodes with external quantum
              efficiencies exceeding 20 per cent-approaching those of
              commercial organic light-emitting diodes-have been demonstrated
              in both the infrared and the green emission channels1,3,4.
              However, owing to the formation of lower-bandgap iodide-rich
              domains, efficient and colour-stable red electroluminescence from
              mixed-halide perovskites has not yet been realized5,6. Here we
              report the treatment of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with
              multidentate ligands to suppress halide segregation under
              electroluminescent operation. We demonstrate colour-stable, red
              emission centred at 620 nanometres, with an electroluminescence
              external quantum efficiency of 20.3 per cent. We show that a key
              function of the ligand treatment is to 'clean' the nanocrystal
              surface through the removal of lead atoms. Density functional
              theory calculations reveal that the binding between the ligands
              and the nanocrystal surface suppresses the formation of iodine
              Frenkel defects, which in turn inhibits halide segregation. Our
              work exemplifies how the functionality of metal halide
              perovskites is extremely sensitive to the nature of the
              (nano)crystalline surface and presents a route through which to
              control the formation and migration of surface defects. This is
              critical to achieve bandgap stability for light emission and
              could also have a broader impact on other optoelectronic
              applications-such as photovoltaics-for which bandgap stability is
              required.",

               perovskite light-emitting diodes, non-radiative charge
               recombination has limited the electroluminescence efficiency.
               Here we demonstrate perovskite--polymer bulk heterostructure
               light-emitting diodes exhibiting external quantum efficiencies
               of up to 20.1\% (at current densities of 0.1--1 mA cm−2). The
               light-emitting diode emissive layer comprises
               quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskites
               and an insulating polymer. Photogenerated excitations migrate
               from quasi-2D to lower-energy sites within 1 ps, followed by
               radiative bimolecular recombination in the 3D regions. From

               the device brightness and stability (T50 = 46 h in air at peak

              cells contain toxic lead, a sustainable procedure for handling

              perovskite solar cells. The inherent cognition impels researchers
              to prepare perovskite films in water-controlled conditions.
              Herein, water is used as a green solvent to prepare CsPbBr3 films
              through a two-step spin-coating method. Due to the high
              solubility of CsBr but low solubility of PbBr2 in water, it
              provides a possibility to deposit CsBr onto PbBr2 from water

  abstract  = "ConspectusPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have, in recent years,
               become one of the most in-depth photovoltaic materials in many
               different disciplines due to their long-range charge carrier
               diffusion lengths, strong light absorption, easy tuning of the
               band gaps, low defect density, and solution processability. The
               power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has
               reached a certified value of 25.5\%, which has caught up with or
               even surpassed traditional photovoltaic technologies, such as
               silicon (Si) solar cells, thin film solar cell, etc. In addition
               to the performance of PSCs comparable to traditional
               photovoltaic technology, its biggest feature is that it can be
               prepared by a solution method. The preparation process of the
               solution method simplify the film preparation process and
               greatly reduce the preparation cost. In addition, the solution
               method provides a favorable option for the energy supply of
               flexible wearable devices in the future.At present, the
               preparation of PSCs mainly uses organic molecular solvents,
               including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide
               (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and their mixed solvents.
               However, most of these commonly used organic solvents are unsafe
               and are likely to cause water and soil pollution, harm to the
               human body, and safety accidents. In addition, most solvents
               have a high coordination number, which limits the
               crystallization of perovskite. Furthermore, high-quality
               perovskite films require the introduction of a large amount of
               high boiling point, polar and aprotic antisolvents to assist
               crystallization, such as chlorobenzene, ether, and ethyl
               acetate. In addition to the toxicological problems of the
               antisolvent, the technology has a relatively narrow operating
               time window, relatively high operating environment requirements,
               and relatively low repeatability, which greatly limits the
               large-scale production of PSCs. Therefore, It is very necessary
               to develop a new solvent engineering technology for PSCs, which
               is green and pollution-free, is a simple process, and has high
               efficiency, long-term stability, and low cost. Recently, we have
               developed a series of ionic liquids, including MAAc, MAFa, BAAc,
               etc., which can be used as solvents to prepare efficient and
               stable PSCs. It allows the production of smooth and continuous
               polycrystalline perovskite thin films in ambient air through a
               simple spin coating methodIn this Account, we started with the
               discovery of ionic liquids as solvents to PSCs. We have proposed
               new strategies for improving and enhancing ionic liquid-based
               PSCs, including interface engineering, solvent engineering, and
               additive engineering. Furthermore, the stable and efficient
               mechanism of ionic liquid-based perovskite solar cells has been
               revealed. In view of the designable characteristics of ionic
               liquids, some functional ionic liquids have been designed and
               applied to different systems of halide perovskites, which has
               important guiding significance for the development of more

               Herein, high-quality CsPbBr3 films are prepared using all green

               components during film formation and crystallization remains
               mysterious. Here, we show the management of perovskite
               intermediates to construct perovskite films with uniform
               perovskite crystals and controlled surface morphology using
               methylammonium acetate (MAAc) to retard the reaction between
               PbI2 and MAI in the solution. The formation of MAPbI3 was
               allowed via the exchange of I− anions from the neighboring MAI
               molecules to the perovskite intermediate phases replacing Ac−
               anions. A highly efficient perovskite solar cell with a power
               conversion efficiency of 18.09\% was achieved. The experimental
               and theoretical studies reveal that perovskite intermediates
               play an important role in facilitating homogeneous nucleation or
               modulating the crystallization kinetics. These results also
               provide important progress towards the understanding of
               perovskite intermediate phases for advancing the building of
               perovskite semiconductors.",

               a novel solvent for facile fabrication of perovskite solar cells
               (PSCs) in ambient air. MAAc possesses excellent chemical
               properties along with high viscosity, negligible vapor pressure,
               and a nonhazardous nature. Complete solubility of both
               methylammonium and lead salts by hydrogen bonds in MAAc was
               observed. Dense and pinhole-free perovskite films with high
               reproducibility can be readily prepared by a simple one-step
               method without an anti-solvent even under a relative humidity of
               over 80\%. Under optimized processing conditions, we achieved an
               average power conversion efficiency of 18.42\% and a maximum
               efficiency of 20.05\% in CH3NH3PbI3-based planar heterojunction

               the nature of perovskite absorption features and optical
               properties. Films obtained from the deposition of solutions
               containing lead halides and the CH3NH3+ organic cation is known
               to yield the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure upon annealing. In
               examining the precursor solution used in the processing of
               CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, we find that Pb2+ readily forms plumbate
               complexes in the presence of excess iodide ions and exhibits
               characteristic absorption bands at 370 (PbI3−) and 425 nm
               (PbI42−). Through comparative spectral analysis of the
               absorption features of charge transfer complexes in the solution
               phase and the final solid-state perovskite films, we are able to
               fully classify the absorption features in the excited state of
               CH3NH3PbI3 across the transient absorption spectrum recorded
               following laser pulse excitation. In particular, we attribute
               the broad photoinduced absorption to a charge-transfer excited
               state, and show correlation between the photoinduced absorption
               and 480 nm bleach signals. These observations lead us to propose
               a band structure composed of two distinct transitions that is
               consistent with the various spectral features and kinetic
               behavior of the CH3NH3PbI3 excited state. Characterization of

               CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited by means of a Lewis acid--base adduct
               approach. We show by high-resolution transmission electron
               microscopy lattice images that adding 6 mol\% excess CH3NH3I to
               the precursor solution resulted in a CH3NH3I layer forming at
               the grain boundaries. This layer is responsible for suppressing
               non-radiative recombination and improving hole and electron

               cells (PSCs), the concern of toxic lead ions remains a major

               (Sn)-based PSCs outperform the reported Pb-free perovskites in
               terms of photovoltaic performance. However, it is of a
               particularly great challenge to develop effective passivation
               strategies to suppress Sn(II) induced defect densities and
               oxidation for attaining high-performance all-inorganic CsSnI3
               PSCs. Herein, a facile yet effective thioamides passivation
               strategy to modulate defect state density at surfaces and grain
               boundaries in CsSnI3 perovskites is reported. The
               thiosemicarbazide (TSC) with S?C?N functional groups can make
               strong coordination interaction with charge defects, leading to
               enhanced electron cloud density around defects and increased
               vacancy formation energies. Importantly, the surface passivation
               can reduce the deep level trap state defect density originated

               restraining nonradiative recombination and elongating the

               structure is in situ formed by fumigating 3D perovskites with

               triple-cation perovskite layer which has been used most recently
               is cesium-containing FAPbI3-based perovskite. One of decent
               approaches to fabricate the layer is spin-coating technique by
               using two-step deposition process in which mixed lead-halide and
               CsI precursor is firstly spin-coated onto a substrate, then
               organic cation solution is deposited on the lead-halide layer.
               In this work, the results show that the performance of the
               devices from this process is lower than expected that could be
               due to difficulty of cesium ion incorporation as a stabilizer
               for FAPbI3-based perovskite. Perovskite seeding growth is
               introduced to solve the problem where the process is slightly
               modified from conventional two-step deposition methods by adding
               small amount of perovskite seed precursor into PbI2 solution.
               The concentration of the perovskite seed in PbI2 solution was
               varied for 0, 7, 14 and 20\% v/v. The highest average efficiency
               of 11.9\% was obtained from 7\% v/v seeding concentration.
               Furthermore, the device performance could be improved by using
               proper amount of chlorobenzene (CB) as an anti-solvent. The
               highest efficiency of 18.4\% was achieved by using 30 µl of
               chlorobenzene.",

               nm), area (from 0.5 $\times$ 0.5 cm2 to 5 $\times$ 5 cm2) and
               patterning on different substrates. Printing rates in excess of
               20 cm s−1 and close to 100\% ink use were achieved. Using this

               however, employ infinitesimal core--shell QDs which inherently
               have different electron and hole mobilities. As QDs are the core
               building blocks of QD-LEDs, the inherent mobility difference in
               the core--shell QDs causes significantly unbalanced charge
               carrier transport, resulting in detrimental effects on
               performances of QD-LEDs. Herein, we introduce a post-chemical
               treatment to reconstruct the QD films through the
               solvent-mediated self-organization process. The treatment using
               various poly-alkyl alcohol groups enables QD ensembles to

               transport. In particular, ethanol-treated QD films exhibit
               enhanced charge carrier lifetime and reduced hysteresis due to
               the balanced charge carrier transport, which is attributed to
               the preferential-facet-oriented QD post-organization. As a
               result, 63, 78, and 54\% enhancements in the external quantum

              charge carrier mobilities have been reported using different

               accounting for both early-time recombination and the evolution

               of 8.0 +/? 0.6 cm2 (V s)?1, which is ten times greater than the

               This previously unreported concurrence between the long-range

              Pb halide perovskite (HaP), a crucial factor for their use in
              photovoltaics, light emission, and radiation detection, remains a
              matter of discussion, in part because of the difficulty in
              determining these densities. Here, we present a powerful approach
              to assess the defect densities, based on electric field mapping
              in working HaP-based solar cells. The minority carrier diffusion
              lengths were deduced from the electric field profile, measured by
              electron beam-induced current (EBIC). The EBIC method was used
              earlier to get the first direct evidence for the n-i-p junction
              structure, at the heart of efficient HaP-based PV cells, and
              later by us and others for further HaP studies. This manuscript
              includes EBIC results on illuminated cell cross sections (in
              operando) at several light intensities to compare optoelectronic
              characteristics of different cells made by different groups in
              several laboratories. We then apply a simple, effective
              single-level defect model that allows deriving the densities (Nr)
              of the defect acting as recombination center. We find Nr
              $\approx$ 1 $\times$ 1013 cm-3 for mixed A cation lead
              bromide-based HaP films and ∼1 $\times$ 1014 cm-3 for
              MAPbBr3(Cl). As EBIC photocurrents are similar at the grain bulk
              and boundaries, we suggest that the defects are at the interfaces
              with selective contacts rather than in the HaP film. These
              results are relevant for photovoltaic devices as the EBIC
              responses distinguish clearly between high- and low-efficiency
              devices. The most efficient devices have n-i-p structures with a
              close-to-intrinsic HaP film, and the selective contacts then
              dictate the electric field strength throughout the HaP absorber.",

               widespread spatial heterogeneity in devices. Conventional
               techniques to assess heterogeneities can be time consuming,
               operate only at microscopic length scales, and demand

               transport layers, thereby ranking them by suitability for
               upscaling. We reveal that top-contacting transport layers are
               the dominant source of heterogeneity in the multilayer material

               (TMDs), has recently emerged as an intriguing way to design

               important questions such as the exact impact of the mobile ions
               on the steady-state power conversion efficiency (PCE) and

               mobile ions out of their equilibrium position at fast scan
               speeds ( $\approx$ 1000?V?s?1). The ?ion-free? PCE is between
               1\% and 3\% higher than the steady-state PCE, demonstrating the
               importance of ion-induced losses, even in cells with low levels
               of hysteresis at typical scan speeds ( $\approx$ 100?mV?s?1).
               The hysteresis over many orders of magnitude in scan speed

               bandgap (>1.7 eV) metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) are becoming a
               major focus of academic and industrial photovoltaic research.
               Compared to their lower bandgap ($\leq$1.6 eV) counterparts,
               these types of perovskites suffer from higher levels of
               non-radiative losses in both the bulk material and in device
               configurations, constraining their efficiencies far below their
               thermodynamic potential. In this work, we investigate the energy
               losses in methylammonium (MA) free high-Br-content wide bandgap
               perovskites by using a combination of THz spectroscopy,
               steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, coupled with
               drift-diffusion simulations. The investigation of this system
               allows us to study charge-carrier recombination in these
               materials and devices in the absence of halide segregation due
               to the photostabilty of formamidinium-cesium based lead halide
               perovskites. We find that these perovskites are characterised by
               large non-radiative recombination losses in the bulk material
               and that the interfaces with transport layers in solar cell
               devices strongly limit their open-circuit voltage. In
               particular, we discover that the interface with the hole
               transport layer performs particularly poorly, in contrast to 1.6
               eV bandgap MHPs which are generally limited by the interface
               with the electron-transport layer. To overcome these losses, we
               incorporate and investigate the recombination mechanisms present
               with perovskites treated with the ionic additive
               1-butyl-1-methylpipiderinium tetrafluoroborate. We find that
               this additive not only improves the radiative efficiency of the
               bulk perovskite, but also reduces the non-radiative
               recombination at both the hole and electron transport layer
               interfaces of full photovoltaic devices. In addition to
               unravelling the beneficial effect of this specific treatment, we
               further optimise our solar cells by introducing an additional
               LiF interface treatment at the electron transport layer

               photoluminescence quantum yields by more than an order of

               charge-transfer (MCT) model. In this work, we show that
               combining the radiative limit and MCT models for voltage loss
               calculations provides useful insights into the physics of
               emerging efficient OSCs. We studied nine different
               donor--acceptor systems, wherein the power conversion efficiency
               ranges from 4.4 to 14.1\% and $\Delta$VOC varies from 0.55 to
               0.95 V. For these state-of-the-art devices, we calculated the
               $\Delta$VOC using the radiative limit and the MCT model.
               Furthermore, we combined both models to derive new insights on
               the origin of radiative voltage losses ($\Delta$Vrad) in OSCs.
               We quantified the contribution in $\Delta$Vrad due to the bulk
               intramolecular (S1) disorder and interfacial intermolecular (CT)
               disorder by revisiting the spectral regions of interest for

               relationship of VOC with Urbach energy (EU), which suggests that
               the low EU is beneficial for reduced losses. However,
               unprecedentedly, we also identify a universal, almost linear
               relationship between the interfacial disorder ($\lambda$) and
               $\Delta$Vrad. We believe that these results can be exploited by
               the organic photovoltaic (OPV) community for the design of new

              octahedral Ag+/Bi3+ network as in spinel, but occupancy of the
              tetrahedral interstitials by Cu+ differs from those in spinel.
              The 3D octahedral network of CuAgBiI5 allows us to identify a
              relationship between octahedral site occupancy (composition) and
              octahedral motif (structure) across the whole CuI-AgI-BiI3 phase
              field, giving the ability to chemically control structural
              dimensionality. To investigate composition-structure-property
              relationships, we compare the basic optoelectronic properties of
              CuAgBiI5 with those of Cu2AgBiI6 (which has a 2D octahedral
              network) and reveal a surprisingly low sensitivity to the
              dimensionality of the octahedral network. The absorption onset of
              CuAgBiI5 (2.02 eV) barely changes compared with that of Cu2AgBiI6

              dimensionality of the octahedral network from 3D to 2D. Changes
              in photoluminescence spectra and lifetimes between the two
              compounds mostly derive from the difference in extrinsic defect
              densities rather than intrinsic effects. While both materials

               optoelectronic devices, featuring high crystallinity and
               stability. However, a high trap density and structural
               nonuniformity at the surface have been major barriers to the
               progress of single crystal-based optoelectronic devices. Here,
               the formation of a unique nanoisland structure is reported at
               the surface of the facet-controlled cuboid MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+)
               single crystals through a cation interdiffusion process enabled
               by energetically vaporized CsI. The interdiffusion of mobile
               ions between the bulk and the surface is triggered by thermally
               activated CsI vapor, which reconstructs the surface that is rich
               in MA and CsI with reduced dangling bonds. Simultaneously, an
               array of Cs-Pb-rich nanoislands is constructed on the surface of
               the MAPbI3 single crystals. This newly reconstructed nanoisland
               surface enhances the light absorbance over 50\% and increases
               the charge carrier mobility from 56 to 93 cm2 V?1 s?1. As
               confirmed by Kelvin probe force microscopy, the nanoislands form
               a gradient band bending that prevents recombination of excess
               carriers, and thus, enhances lateral carrier transport
               properties. This unique engineering of the single crystal

               investigated, using a combination of voltage dependent
               photoluminescence (PL) timeseries and various charge extraction
               measurements. It is demonstrated that the Pb/Sn-perovskite
               devices suffer from a reduction in the charge extraction
               efficiency within the first few seconds of operation, which
               leads to a loss in current and lower maximum power output. In
               addition, the emitted PL from the device rises on the exact same
               timescales due to the accumulation of electronic charges in the
               active layer. Using transient charge extraction measurements, it
               is shown that these observations cannot be explained by
               doping-induced electronic charges but by the movement of mobile
               ions toward the perovskite/transport layer interfaces, which
               inhibits charge extraction due to band flattening. Finally,
               these findings are generalized to lead-based perovskites,
               showing that the loss mechanism is universal. This elucidates
               the negative role mobile ions play in perovskite solar cells and
               paves a path toward understanding and mitigating a key loss
               mechanism.",

               building upon the success of lead halide perovskites. In these
               materials, charge-lattice couplings fundamentally determine
               charge transport, critically affecting device performance. In
               this study, we investigate the optoelectronic properties of the
               recently discovered lead-free semiconductor Cu2AgBiI6 using
               temperature-dependent photoluminescence, absorption, and
               optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We report ultrafast
               charge-carrier localization effects, evident from sharp THz
               photoconductivity decays occurring within a few picoseconds
               after excitation and a rise in intensity with decreasing
               temperature of long-lived, highly Stokes-shifted
               photoluminescence. We conclude that charge carriers in Cu2AgBiI6
               are subject to strong charge-lattice coupling. However, such
               small polarons still exhibit mobilities in excess of 1 cm2 V--1
               s--1 at room temperature because of low energetic barriers to
               formation and transport. Together with a low exciton binding
               energy of ∼29 meV and a direct band gap near 2.1 eV, these

               (HTMs) have been implicated in the degradation, and metal oxide
               layers are proposed as alternatives. One of the most prominent
               metal oxide HTM in organic photovoltaics is MoO3. However, the
               use of MoO3 as HTM in metal halide perovskite-based devices
               causes a severe solar cell deterioration. Thus, the formation of
               the MoO3/CH3NH3PbI3--xClx (MAPbI3--xClx) heterojunction is
               systematically studied by synchrotron-based hard X-ray
               photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
               energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.
               Upon MoO3 deposition, significant chemical interaction is
               induced at the MoO3/MAPbI3--xClx interface: substoichiometric
               molybdenum oxide is present, and the perovskite decomposes in
               the proximity of the interface, leading to accumulation of PbI2
               on the MoO3 cover layer. Furthermore, we find evidence for the
               formation of new compounds such as PbMoO4, PbN2O2, and PbO as a
               result of the MAPbI3--xClx decomposition and suggest chemical
               reaction pathways to describe the underlying mechanism. These

               may be inherently unstable. It provides an explanation for the
               low power conversion efficiencies of metal halide perovskite

              chemical, or optoelectronic properties. Here, we report the

              wide-band-gap semiconductor, well suited for use in lead-free
              tandem photovoltaics. We measure a very high absorption
              coefficient of 1.0 $\times$ 105 cm-1 near the absorption onset,
              several times that of CH3NH3PbI3. Solution-processed Cu2AgBiI6
              thin films show a direct band gap of 2.06(1) eV, an exciton

              mini-modules. With a combined strategy of active layer
              engineering, interfacial optimization, surface treatments, and

               by co-evaporation, power conversion efficiencies of over 20\%
               have been already demonstrated, however, so far, only in n-i-p
               configuration. Currently, the overall major challenges are the
               complex evaporation characteristics of organic precursors that
               strongly depend on the underlying charge selective contacts and
               the insufficient reproducibility of the co-evaporation process.
               To ensure a reliable co-evaporation process, it is important to
               identify the impact of different parameters in order to develop
               a more detailed understanding. In this work, we study the
               influence of the substrate temperature, underlying
               hole-transport layer (polymer PTAA versus self-assembling
               monolayer molecule MeO-2PACz), and perovskite precursor ratio on
               the morphology, composition, and performance of co-evaporated
               p-i-n perovskite solar cells. We first analyze the evaporation
               of pure precursor materials and show that the adhesion of
               methylammonium iodide (MAI) is significantly reduced with
               increased substrate temperature, while it remains almost
               unaffected for lead iodide (PbI2). This substrate
               temperature-dependent evaporation behavior of MAI is also
               transferred to the co-evaporation process and can directly
               influence the perovskite composition. We demonstrate that the
               optimal substrate temperature window for perovskite deposition
               is close to room temperature. At high temperature, not enough
               MAI for precise stoichiometry is incorporated even with very
               high MAI rates. While, at temperatures below −25 °C, the
               conversion of MAI with PbI2 is inhibited, and an amorphous yet
               unreacted film is formed. We observe that perovskite composition
               and morphology vary widely between the organic hole-transport
               layers (HTLs) PTAA and MeO-2PACz. For all substrate
               temperatures, MeO-2PACz enables higher solar cell PCEs than
               PTAA. Through the combination of vapor-deposited perovskites and
               a self-assembled monolayer, we achieve a stabilized power
               conversion efficiency of 20.6\%, which is the first reported PCE
               above 20\% for evaporated perovskite solar cells in p-i-n

               large-area depositions of lead halide perovskites. However, the
               vapor deposition of perovskites is constrained by its low
               reproducibility, whereby in particular the evaporation of
               methylammonium iodide (MAI) is frequently reported as extremely
               challenging. Herein, the influence of impurities on the
               evaporation dynamics of MAI is analyzed. It is proved that MAI
               heated in a high vacuum, depending on the purity, either
               undergoes a sublimation with a subsequent desublimation or a
               chemical decomposition with a following reverse reaction,
               leading to solid MAI in both cases. In situ mass spectrometry
               enables us to show that low purity MAI containing water and
               methylammonium phosphite impurities mainly sublimes, which
               results in a directional and by crystal microbalances traceable
               evaporation. In contrast, high purity MAI sublimes at higher
               temperatures and tends to form decomposition products such as
               methylamine and hydrogen iodide, which omnidirectional diffuse
               and can react with lead iodide to perovskite. The findings

               challenge for formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is to suppress
               the phase transition from the photoactive black phase into
               yellow nonperovskite $\delta$-phase. Several approaches to
               stabilize the black phase have been developed for solution-based
               perovskites, whereas so far, vacuum-deposited FAPbI3 has rarely
               been reported. This study demonstrates the preparation of FAPbI3
               by co-evaporation and discusses the influence of the subjacent
               hole transporting layer (HTL) on its phase stability. By using
               FAI excess in the evaporation process in combination with
               phosphonic acids groups from the HTL, the black perovskite phase

               optimized MAI to FAI ratios, maintaining 100\% of the initial

              to their simple manufacturing, high optoelectronic performance,
              and low manufacturing cost. In this regard, spin-coating method
              facilitates the fabrication of perovskite devices. However, the
              spin-coating method for perovskite film deposition is difficult
              to finely control the thickness and form a uniform surface. Thus.
              the thermal evaporation method was proposed to overcome these
              shortcomings. This method provides better reproducibility and
              film quality than the spin-coating method. In this review, the
              spin-coating method and thermal evaporation method used to
              manufacture perovskite thin films will be explained. Moreover,

              solvent-free characteristic, precise control of film thickness,

              power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs fabricated by vacuum
              evaporation lags behind that of solution-processed PSCs. Here, we
              report a Cl-containing alloy-mediated sequential vacuum
              evaporation approach to fabricate perovskite films. The presence
              of Cl in the alloy facilitates organic ammonium halide diffusion
              and the subsequent perovskite conversion reaction, leading to
              homogeneous pinhole-free perovskite films with few defects. The
              resulting PSCs yield a PCE of 24.42\%, 23.44\% (certified
              22.6\%), and 19.87\% for 0.1, 1.0, and 14.4 square centimeters

  abstract  = "Metal halide perovskite-based solar cells have attracted
               considerable attention in recent years owing to their
               inexpensive and easy fabrication and rapidly increasing
               efficiencies, which already match those of the industrially
               dominant multi-crystalline silicon. The incorporation of
               perovskite absorber materials into multiple (multi-)junction
               cells could potentially allow us to go well beyond silicon-based
               technology and reach even higher power conversion efficiencies.
               Layering multiple solar-absorber junctions on top of each other
               enables the absorption of different regions of the solar
               spectrum, so that more energy can be extracted from sunlight.
               The possibility of tuning the bandgap of perovskite materials
               over a wide range, along with the ability to generate high
               open-circuit voltages from wide-bandgap absorbers, make
               perovskites ideal candidates. Perovskites can be used in
               combination with or as a substitute for silicon in photovoltaic
               technologies already in use and can be assembled in hybrid
               tandem architectures or layered in all-perovskite multi-junction

              years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However,
              the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention

               Se and Cd, are substituted, respectively, in CuInGaSe2 and CdTe.
               To overcome the abundance limitation of Te and In, in recent
               times new thin film materials, such as Cu2ZnSnS4 or SnS, have
               been investigated. In this paper we analyze the limitations of

               deposited by thermal evaporation is analyzed by X-ray
               diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
               and atomic force microscopy. The raw material is also analyzed
               and a different composition is observed according to the
               different number of evaporation (runs). The sulfur loss
               represents one of the major challenges of SnS solar cell

               and compact structure were prepared by adjusting the spin
               coating process parameters. On such a basis, the PbS/PbI2
               heterojunction was fabricated on the PbI2 surface by the method
               of in situ chemical replacement growth. The results show that
               the PbS/PbI2 heterojunction grown by this method has a clear
               interface and is closely combined. The introduction of a PbS
               layer enables its spectral response range to cover the visible
               and near-infrared regions. Compared with the PbI2 thin film
               device, its responsivity is increased by three orders of
               magnitude, its response time reduced by 42\%, and its recovery
               time decreased by nearly 1/2 under 450 nm illumination. In the
               case that there is no response for the PbI2 thin film device

               PbS/PbI2 heterojunction device still amounts to 1.8 $\times$ 108

               stability in air, and recent demonstrations of long
               charge-carrier lifetimes that can exceed 1 µs. In particular,
               Cs2AgBiBr6 is the subject of many investigations in photovoltaic
               devices. However, the efficiencies of solar cells based on this
               double perovskite are still far from the theoretical efficiency
               limit of the material. Here, the role of grain size on the
               optoelectronic properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films is
               investigated. It is shown through cathodoluminescence
               measurements that grain boundaries are the dominant nonradiative
               recombination sites. It also demonstrates through field-effect
               transistor and temperature-dependent transient current
               measurements that grain boundaries act as the main channels for
               ion transport. Interestingly, a positive correlation between
               carrier mobility and temperature is found, which resembles the
               hopping mechanism often seen in organic semiconductors. These

               This work shows that mitigating the impact of grain boundaries

               as interfacial materials between the perovskite absorber and the
               C60 electron transporting layer. Benefiting from the decent
               electron mobility and good electron extraction and transporting
               properties of the PDI derivative-based interfacial materials,
               the charge transport is improved and the charge recombination at
               the interface is mitigated in the inverted PSCs. As a result, an
               inverted PSC with the PDI-T interlayer material exhibits a
               maximum efficiency of 20.41\% and an excellent fill factor (FF)
               of 83.63\%, representing one of the best values achieved in
               inverted PSCs. The PDI-V-based device shows a comparable
               efficiency of 20.17\% and an excellent FF of 82.98\%. The
               efficiencies over 20\% achieved in this study are among the

               is the deposition of a low-bandgap absorber without damaging

               Here, we demonstrate a method to dual-source coevaporate
               low-bandgap perovskite films and devices. We used mixtures
               formed by melting of metal halides as a single-crucible source

              been achieved in the past a few years. However, the presence of
              lead (Pb) in perovskite composition as a toxic element still
              remains a major issue for large-scale deployment. In this work, a
              novel and facile technique is presented to fabricate tin
              (Sn)-rich perovskite film using metal precursors and an alloying
              technique. Herein, the perovskite films are formed as a result of
              the reaction between Sn/Pb binary alloy metal precursors and
              methylammonium iodide (MAI) vapor in a chemical vapor deposition
              process carried out at 185 °C. It is found that in this approach
              the Pb/Sn precursors are first converted to (Pb/Sn)I2 and further
              reaction with MAI vapor leads to the formation of perovskite
              films. By using Pb-Sn eutectic alloy, perovskite films with large
              grain sizes up to 5 µm can be grown directly from liquid phase
              metal. Consequently, using an alloying technique and this unique
              growth mechanism, a less-toxic and efficient perovskite solar
              cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.04\% is

               semiconducting layers in a broad range of optoelectronic
               applications. Despite extensive investigation of deposition by
               thermal evaporation in the field of perovskite solar cells,
               solution-processed perovskite devices still significantly
               outperform those fabricated by thermal evaporation, particularly
               in the case of methylammonium-free perovskite compositions.
               Herein, we fabricate and investigate thermally evaporated
               Cs0.1FAxPbI2+xBr0.1 perovskite solar cells and explore the
               effects of FAI deficiency or excess and that of post-annealing

               find that annealing can significantly improve the optical and
               structural properties of FAI-poor perovskite layers, resulting
               in a stark enhancement of their photovoltaic performance. While
               stoichiometric devices are also improved, albeit to a lesser

               detrimental for the FAI-rich devices, resulting in a drastic
               loss of performance. We show that annealed stoichiometric
               devices with an optimised active layer thickness result in power
               conversion efficiencies of up to 16.6\%, approaching the

               The performance of 3D hybrid organic--inorganic perovskite solar
               cells has increased at an incredible rate, reaching power
               conversion efficiencies comparable to those of many established
               technologies. However, the commercial application of 3D hybrid
               perovskites is inhibited by their poor stability. Relative to 3D
               hybrid perovskites, low-dimensional --- that is, 2D --- hybrid
               perovskites have demonstrated higher moisture stability,
               offering new approaches to stabilizing perovskite-based
               photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, 2D hybrid perovskites have
               versatile structures, enabling the fine-tuning of their
               optoelectronic properties through compositional engineering. In
               this Review, we discuss the state of the art in 2D perovskites,
               providing an overview of structural and materials engineering
               aspects and optical and photophysical properties. Moreover, we
               discuss recent developments along with the main limitations of
               3D perovskites and assess the advantages of 2D perovskites over
               their 3D parent structures in terms of stability. Finally, we
               review recent achievements in combining 3D and 2D perovskites as
               an approach to simultaneously boost device efficiency and
               stability, paving the way for mixed-dimensional perovskite solar

               3D perovskites is a promising approach to achieve stable and

               structural, optical and photophysical properties of
               low-dimensional perovskites, compare the stability and
               efficiency of 2D and 3D perovskite devices, and consider 2D/3D

              earth-abundant, nontoxic, and air-stable absorbers for
              photovoltaic applications. However, the semiconductors explored
              thus far have slowly-rising absorption onsets, and their
              charge-carrier transport is not well understood yet. Herein, we
              investigate cation-disordered NaBiS2 nanocrystals, which have a
              steep absorption onset, with absorption coefficients reaching
              >105 cm-1 just above its pseudo-direct bandgap of 1.4 eV.
              Surprisingly, we also observe an ultrafast (picosecond-time
              scale) photoconductivity decay and long-lived charge-carrier
              population persisting for over one microsecond in NaBiS2
              nanocrystals. These unusual features arise because of the
              localised, non-bonding S p character of the upper valence band,
              which leads to a high density of electronic states at the band
              edges, ultrafast localisation of spatially-separated electrons
              and holes, as well as the slow decay of trapped holes. This work
              reveals the critical role of cation disorder in these systems on
              both absorption characteristics and charge-carrier kinetics.",

  abstract = "The discovery of new materials and their efficient syntheses is a
              fundamental goal of chemistry. A related objective is to identify
              foundational and rational approaches to enhance the art of
              synthesis by combining the exquisite predictability of organic
              synthesis with the high yields of solid-state chemistry. In
              contrast to so-called solid-state methods, inorganic syntheses in
              liquid fluxes permit bond formation, framework assembly, and
              crystallization at lower temperatures because of facile diffusion
              and chemical reactions with and within the flux itself. The
              fluxes are bona fide solvents similar to conventional organic or
              aqueous solvents. Such reactions can produce a wide range of
              materials, often metastable, from oxides to intermetallics, but
              typically the formation mechanisms are poorly understood. This
              article discusses how one can design, perform, observe,
              understand, and engineer the formation of compounds from
              inorganic melts. The focus is also design concepts such as
              ``dimensional reduction'', ``phase homologies'', and ``panoramic
              synthesis'', and their broad applicability. When well-defined
              building blocks are present and stable in the reaction, prospects
              for increased structural diversity and product control increase
              substantially. Common structural motifs within these materials
              systems may be related to structural precursors in the melt that
              may be controlled by tuning reaction conditions and composition.
              Stabilization of a particular building block is often
              accomplished with tuning of the flux composition, which controls
              the Lewis basicity and redox potential. In such tunable and
              dynamic fluxes, the synthesis can be directed toward new
              materials. Using complementary techniques of in situ X-ray
              diffraction, we can create time-dependent maps of reaction space
              and probe the mobile species present in melts. Certain thoughts
              toward the ultimate goal of targeted materials synthesis by
              controlling inorganic melt chemistry are discussed.",

              defects in binary rock-salt materials were studied using the
              first-principles method. A novel, stable, and energetically
              competitive interstitial site (base-interstitial) was identified
              for anion interstitials in rock-salts. The formation energies of
              base-interstitial defects were compared with well-explored
              tetrahedral (body-interstitial) and split interstitials and were
              found to be energetically highly competitive. For alkali halides
              and silver bromide, the lowest formation energies are associated
              with the base-interstitial site and the split interstitial, which
              are therefore the predominant interstitial sites. However, split
              interstitials were found to be the energetically preferred
              configuration in metal monochalcogenide systems. Electronic band
              structures are affected by the presence of interstitial defects
              in rock-salt structures. In particular, the Fermi level is
              shifted below the valence band maxima for the body, base, and
              split interstitials in metal halides, indicating p-type
              conductivity. However, the Fermi level remains within the bandgap
              for metal monochalcogenides, indicating no preferred conductivity
              for base- and split-interstitial defects. Allowing the defects to
              be charged changes the relative stability of the interstitial
              sites. However, the new base-interstitial site remains preferred
              over a range of potentials for alkali halides. The anion
              base-interstitial is found to form a triatomic entity with the
              nearest lattice anions that affect the electronic structure

              interstitial site affects our understanding of defects in binary
              rock-salts, including structure and dynamics as well as

  abstract = "Being a best-known prototype of phase-change materials, GeTe was
              reported to possess many high-pressure phases, whose structural
              evolution and superconductivity remain under debate for decades.
              Herein, we systematically investigated the pressure dependence of
              electrical transport and the structural evolution of the GeTe
              viain situangle-dispersive synchrotron x-ray diffraction and
              resistance measurements up to 55 GPa. At room temperature, the
              structural phase transitions from the initial rhombohedral phase
              to theFm3̄mphase, and then to an orthorhombicPnmaphase, were
              observed at pressures of about 4 and 13.4 GPa, respectively.
              Furthermore, the metallization occurred at around 11 GPa, where
              the superconductivity could also be observed. With increasing
              pressure, the superconducting transition temperature increases
              monotonically from 5.7 to 6.4 K and then is independent of
              pressure above 23 GPa in the purePnmaphase. These results provide
              insights into the pressure-dependent evolution of the structure
              and superconductivity in GeTe and have implications for the
              understanding of other IV-VI semiconductors at high pressure.",

  abstract  = "Inorganic--organic perovskites have been considered as one type
               of promising photoelectric material. However, there are two
               aspects hindering their application in practice. One is the
               toxicity of metal lead and the other is the stability of the
               compound. Herein, the structure, stability, electronic
               properties, and optical properties of six novel perovskites,
               MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and lead-less MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2
               (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75), have been investigated employing the
               density functional theory method. The effects of the
               substitution of Sn/Ge for Pb and Sn-doping on the stability,
               electronic, and optical properties were also considered. The
               calculation of formation enthalpy and ab initio molecular
               dynamics simulations show that the six studied compounds possess
               good thermodynamic stability. The band structure, partial
               density of states, Bader charge analysis, electron localization
               function, and carrier's effective mass were simulated for
               evaluating the electronic properties of the six perovskites. The
               metal tin completely or partially replaces metal Pb of
               MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites, reduces the band gap of the system
               and improves carrier's transport ability. The dielectric
               constants $\epsilon$($\omega$), optical absorption coefficient
               $\alpha$($\omega$), energy loss L($\omega$), refractivity index
               n($\omega$) and reflectivity R($\omega$) were determined for
               estimating the optical properties of the studied compounds. The
               introduction of metal tin also enhances the optical absorption
               range and optical absorption intensity in the UV-vis region.
               Ge-based perovskite has very similar electronic and optical
               properties to the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound, but is lead-free.
               Therefore, among the six studied perovskites, Sn-based systems
               could be ideal materials for use in the absorption layer of
               single junction perovskite solar cells, while the MA2Ge(SCN)2I2
               compound may also be a good substitute for the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2
               compound because it is lead-free with good stability. We hope
               this work can provide a theoretical foundation for the
               development of high-performance and lead-free/partially lead
               free perovskites.",

               technique. In this process, the perovskite film is prepared by

               methylammounium iodide (MAI). In comparison to the common

               of composition, morphology, and surface quality. X-ray
               photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass
               spectrometry show that the I/Pb ratio of the LBLA film is 2.92

               composition of organometallics as compared with TSD with an I/Pb

              optoelectronic devices and yet their effect in halide perovskite
              materials is still not understood. The biggest factor limiting
              progress is the inability to identify grain boundaries.
              Noncrystallographic techniques can misidentify grain boundaries,
              leading to conflicting literature reports about their influence;
              however, the gold standard - electron backscatter diffraction
              (EBSD) - destroys halide perovskite thin films. Here, this
              problem is solved by using a solid-state EBSD detector with 6000
              times higher sensitivity than the traditional phosphor screen and
              camera. Correlating true grain size with photoluminescence
              lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and mobility shows that grain
              boundaries are not benign but have a recombination velocity of
              1670 cm s-1 , comparable to that of crystalline silicon.
              Amorphous grain boundaries are also observed that give rise to
              locally brighter photoluminescence intensity and longer
              lifetimes. This anomalous grain boundary character offers a
              possible explanation for the mysteriously long lifetime and
              record efficiency achieved in small grain halide perovskite thin
              films. It also suggests a new approach for passivating grain

              that not only the composition but also the precise stoichiometry
              is important for the device performance. Recent reports have, for
              example, demonstrated small amount of PbI2 in the perovskite
              films to be beneficial for the overall performance of both the
              standard perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3, as well as for the mixed
              perovskites (CH3NH3)x(CH(NH2)2)(1-x)PbBryI(3-y). In this work a
              broad range of characterization techniques including X-ray
              diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),

              importance of remnant PbI2 in perovskite solar cells. Our best
              devices were over 18\% efficient, and had in line with previous
              results a small amount of excess PbI2. For the PbI2-deficient
              samples, the photocurrent dropped, which could be attributed to
              accumulation of organic species at the grain boundaries, low
              charge carrier mobility, and decreased electron injection into
              the TiO2. The PbI2-deficient compositions did, however, also have
              advantages. The record Voc was as high as 1.20 V and was found in
              PbI2-deficient samples. This was correlated with high crystal
              quality, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and high PL yields and
              was rationalized as a consequence of the dynamics of the
              perovskite formation. We further found the ion migration to be
              obstructed in the PbI2-deficient samples, which decreased the JV
              hysteresis and increased the photostability. PbI2-deficient
              synthesis conditions can thus be used to deposit perovskites with
              excellent crystal quality but with the downside of grain
              boundaries enriched in organic species, which act as a barrier
              toward current transport. Exploring ways to tune the synthesis
              conditions to give the high crystal quality obtained under
              PbI2-poor condition while maintaining the favorable grain

              synthesize high-quality thin films of silver bismuth sulfide
              (AgBiS2). Pure-phase cubic AgBiS2 thin films are prepared, which
              are smooth and dense down to thicknesses less than 40 nm.
              Comprehensive structural and morphological analysis of the
              as-prepared films as a function of processing temperature and
              composition is presented, including X-ray diffraction, X-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The
              optical properties of the films and their electronic band
              structure are also presented. The as-prepared films show
              impressive light absorption properties with absorption
              coefficients reaching 105 cm-1 for energies above ca. 950 nm.
              Finally, their photoactivity is demonstrated through
              photoconductivity measurements on lateral electrodes. The methods
              outlined herein enable the fabrication of AgBiS2 semiconductor
              thin films at low processing temperatures (150 °C) with a dense
              morphology and tunable Ag/Bi composition. Such films provide an

               °C during the dual sources thermal evaporation of CsBr and SnBr2
               instead of routine post-synthetic annealing for the formation of
               crystalline CsSnBr3 film. The effects of annealing temperature
               on the morphology, structure and photophysical properties of the
               CsSnBr3 perovskite films as well as the electroluminescence(EL)
               performance of the PeLED were investigated. Little temperature
               dependence of perovskite emitting layers' morphology was found
               while obviously intensified absorbance, crystallinity and
               steady-state photoluminesce(PL) as well as apparently increased
               PL decay lifetime and slight red-shifted PL spectra of the
               CsSnBr3 perovskite films upon increasing in-situ annealing
               temperature were demonstrated. The similar temperature dependent
               behavior of steady-state PL intensity, transient PL decay life
               time and photoluminescence quantum yield(PLQY) of all the
               CsSnBr3 films verified that the hybrid effect of suppressed deep
               acceptor states and enhanced emitting from shallow trap states
               would be responsible for the PL behavior of in-situ annealed
               CsSnBr3 films. In-situ annealing was also capable of extending
               carriers lifetime and reducing trap density, and leading to the
               occurrence of the suppressed ``self-doping'' of Sn4+ and
               reduction of acceptor states. Meanwhile, the improved crystal
               quality of the CsSnBr3 nanocrystals should be closely related to
               the enhanced charge carriers dynamics and improved PL
               performance. The PeLED with 85 °C in-situ annealed CsSnBr3
               emitting layer demonstrated optimal EL performance with the
               current efficiency(CE) of 0.34 cd/A and external quantum

              study to modify the SnO2 /perovskite interface. Systematic
              experimental results reveal that the HADI serves effectively as a
              multifunctional agent mainly in three aspects: 1) surface
              modification to realign the SnO2 conduction band upward to
              improve interfacial charge extraction; 2) passivating the buried

               has risen rapidly, but continuing this trend requires a clear
               view of all possible sources of power loss. Over the past decade
               in which we have witnessed these remarkable improvements, the
               transparent conductive oxide (TCO) has been widely treated as an
               extrinsic element. While it is recognised that the TCO
               contributes power loss due to finite lateral resistance and
               optical losses, comparatively little attention has been paid to
               the influence of the TCO on the electrostatics in other cell
               layers. However, a recent fill factor (FF) record on a
               centimetre-scale PSC has refocused attention on how the TCO can
               play a significant role in the optoelectronic properties across
               the entire TCO-transport layer-perovskite interface. Primarily,
               this is the consequence of the Schottky-type heterojunction
               formed between the TL and TCO layers, which establishes a
               space-charge region within the TL. Due to the extreme thinness
               of many TL layers, the space charge region can extend the full
               width of the TL and even into the perovskite layer itself. In
               effect, the bulk properties of the TL come to be dominated by
               the equilibrium conditions of this junction, with the
               consequence that the TL can be markedly less conductive once in
               situ within a PSC. This in situ resistance can significantly
               reduce FF, but without knowledge of this mechanism, the source
               of resistance and FF loss would be non-obvious. In this
               contribution, we employ ionic--electronic device models to
               quantify the TCO-induced in situ conductance of the transport
               layer and demonstrate its characteristic appearance in the JV
               curves of high-performance PSCs. We posit that widely used
               titanium dioxide (TiO2) can be particularly susceptible to a low
               in situ conductance, which explains the years-long plateau of
               FFs in TiO2-based PSCs in the low 80\%-range. By comparison to
               inverted PSCs, we illustrate how the TCO influence can explain
               comparative underperformance of FF relative to open-circuit
               voltage and photocurrent in state-of-the-art n--i--p PSCs. We
               hope that by refocusing attention on this factor of PSC design,
               this work can provide a facile path to plausibly lifting single
               junction PSCs beyond 26\% efficiency.",

               a facile and effective strategy to improve the FF to 96.3\% of
               the Shockley--Queisser (S--Q) limit through homogeneous

               dramatically enhanced hole mobility to balance with electron
               mobility. As a result, the non-radiative recombination is
               suppressed along with enhanced carrier extraction efficiency,

              achieve higher lateral conductivities than layers of doped
              spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, combined transient and steady-state
              photoluminescence studies reveal a passivating effect of PEDOT,
              suppressing nonradiative recombination losses at the
              perovskite/HTM interface. This enables excellent quasi-Fermi
              level splitting values of up to 1.24 eV in perovskite/SpiDOT
              layer stacks and high open-circuit voltages ( VOC) up to 1.19 V
              in complete solar cells. Increasing the amount of dopant-free
              spiro-OMeTAD in SpiDOT layers is shown to enhance hole extraction
              and thereby improves the fill factor in solar cells. As a
              consequence, stabilized efficiencies up to 18.7\% are realized,
              exceeding cells with doped spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM in this study.
              Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, these results mark the
              lowest nonradiative recombination loss in the VOC (140 mV with
              respect to the Shockley-Queisser limit) and highest efficiency

               situation is verified for x = 0.80, where the alloy is predicted
               to have a band gap of 0.984, 0.033 eV lower than the gap of

               meet both requirements for formamidinium-based low-bandgap mixed
               tin--lead iodide perovskite solar cells. The bilayer

               high-quality and large-grained perovskite films with only 10
               mol\% volatile methylammonium. Additionally, one-dimensional
               pyrrolidinium perovskite was applied to passivate the perovskite
               film and improve the junction quality, which resulted in a
               carrier lifetime of 1.1 $\mu$s and an open circuit voltage of
               0.865 V for our perovskite film and device with a bandgap of
               1.28 eV. Our strategies enabled a power-conversion efficiency of
               20.4\% for low-bandgap perovskite solar cells under AM 1.5G

              applications of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and
              tandem devices due to outstanding photoelectrical properties and
              low band gaps. Currently, Sn-Pb PSCs typically have a p-i-n
              structure, but choices of hole transport layer (HTL) materials
              are very limited and there are different concerns in each of
              them. Eliminating the HTL is a direct and promising strategy to
              address the concerns, but is rarely studied. In this work, we
              demonstrate HTL-free and MA-free based Sn-Pb PSCs and a
              synergistic integration strategy of simultaneously introducing a
              reducing agent and in situ surface passivation. With the
              integration strategy, Sn-Pb perovskite films with enhanced
              antioxidation, reduced trap density, prolonged carrier lifetime,
              and improved energy-level alignment are achieved. Consequently,
              final HTL-free PSCs exhibit a champion power conversion
              efficiency (PCE) of 17.4\%, which is a new record for HTL-free
              and MA-free Sn-Pb PSCs. Meanwhile, the integration strategy-based
              HTL-free device maintains excellent stability with efficiency
              unchanged for the first 200 h, and finally retaining 81\% of the

               ambient atmosphere with power conversion efficiencies above

               panels, this study introduces a novel element to transform the
               concept of agrivoltaics from just solar-sharing to selective
               utilization of different light wavelengths. Agrivoltaic growth
               of basil and spinach is tested. When compared with classical
               agriculture, and based on the feed-in-tariff of the experimental
               location, agrivoltaic co-generation of biomass and electricity
               is calculated to result in an estimated financial gross gain up
               to +2.5\% for basil and +35\% for spinach. Marketable biomass
               yields do not change significantly for basil, while a
               statistically significant loss is observed for spinach. This is
               accompanied by a relative increase in the protein content for
               both plants grown under agrivoltaic conditions. Agrivoltaics
               implemented with tinted solar panels improve the biomass

               up to 63\% increase in the ratio of leaf and stem biomass to

              perovskite nanocrystals with a size of approximately 10 nm,

              the BPA surrounds the nanocrystals, achieving strong carrier
              confinement. The BPA shell passivates the undercoordinated lead

              bright and stable PeLEDs that have a maximum brightness of

              the realization of spectrally stable pure red perovskite
              light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with a single iodide component,
              because they avoid the halide separation that red
              three-dimensional perovskites of mixed halides have faced.
              However, the distribution of high-order phases in
              solution-processed quasi-2D perovskite films causes the spectral
              shift away from the pure red region. Here, we introduced a simple
              approach of adding excessive ligand combinations to redistribute
              the phase distribution of quasi-2D perovskite and to inhibit the
              high-order phase. Appropriate excess organic ligands will not
              affect charge injection but will keep the efficient energy
              funneling and passivate the defect. The narrowed phase
              distribution reduced the band tail state and restrained reverse
              charge transfer, resulting in enhanced radiation recombination.
              We obtained efficient and spectrally stable pure red PeLEDs at
              638 nm (approaching the Rec. 2020 specification) with a peak EQE

               applications. Here, we investigated (AgI)x(BiI3)y thin films
               with stoichiometric ratios (x/y) of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2
               produced via a low-temperature (<100 °C) spin coating process
               from AgI/BiI3 solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. Several critical
               observations on the basis of ultrafast broadband UV--vis
               transient absorption spectroscopy and photocurrent spectroscopy
               were made for these Ag--Bi--I materials, which will have a
               considerable impact on their photovoltaic performance: Their
               carrier recombination kinetics were independent of the initial
               carrier number density over the range of 1.3--6.6 $\times$ 1017
               cm--3 and well approximated by a monoexponential decay with a
               rate constant krec in the range of 2.0--4.3 $\times$ 108 s--1,
               which is consistent with trap-mediated charge-carrier
               recombination. Moreover, pronounced coherent phonon dynamics was
               observed for all of these (AgI)x(BiI3)y compounds, thereby
               suggesting strong electron--phonon coupling, which will favor
               charge-carrier localization and nonradiative carrier
               recombination, in agreement with the virtually absent
               photoluminescence of these materials. In addition,
               Fourier-transform step-scan photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) on
               AgBi2I7 provided an Urbach energy of 70 meV and found
               indications for deep defects (0.6 eV below the band gap), which
               was also consistent with a trap-mediated recombination
               mechanism. A combination of all of these effects is likely
               responsible for the still quite low light-harvesting performance
               of this class of materials, which has been reported to show
               photovoltaic conversion efficiencies (PCEs) below 5\%. Finally,
               for ``AgI-rich'' compounds (3:1, 2:1), we found a substantial
               separate contribution of carrier loss processes through
               ultrafast relaxation in AgI domains with time constants of 0.73
               and 2.4 ps.",

              promising materials for efficient single- and multi-junction
              photovoltaic devices. This Focus Review discusses the
              optoelectronic properties that underpin this performance, clearly
              differentiating between intrinsic and defect-mediated mechanisms.
              We show that from a fundamental perspective, increasing tin
              fraction may cause increases in attainable charge-carrier
              mobilities, decreases in exciton binding energies, and
              potentially a slowing of charge-carrier cooling, all beneficial
              for photovoltaic applications. We discuss the mechanisms leading
              to significant bandgap bowing along the tin-lead series, which
              enables attractive near-infrared bandgaps at intermediate tin
              content. However, tin-rich stoichiometries still suffer from tin
              oxidation and vacancy formation which often obscures the
              fundamentally achievable performance, causing high background
              hole densities, accelerating charge-carrier recombination,
              lowering charge-carrier mobilities, and blue-shifting absorption
              onsets through the Burstein-Moss effect. We evaluate impacts on
              photovoltaic device performance, and conclude with an outlook on

              photovoltaic technology, though its commercialization could be
              limited by toxicity of lead halides used as absorber materials.
              Lead replacement with other less toxic elements is actively
              discussed and intensively investigated in many research
              laboratories over the world. However, the comparative study of
              the toxicity/hazard effects induced by different metal halides
              (Pb, Sn, Bi), as well as organic counterparts of perovskites
              (i.e., methylammonium or formamidinium halides) is still missing.
              Herein, we present the first systematic in vitro and in vivo
              study of the acute toxicity effects of a panel of the precursors
              commonly applied in the fabrication of PSCs. Surprisingly, we
              found that bio-effects of methylammonium iodide (MAI) are similar
              to that of lead iodide (PbI2) in in vitro models. Furthermore,
              tin iodide (SnI2) is just about ten times less toxic than PbI2
              which makes questionable its potential use as ``eco-friendly''
              material. In vivo experiments demonstrated that MAI and
              formamidinium iodide (FAI) are three times more toxic than PbI2
              in terms of the lethal dose 50\% (LD50). Thus, the presented here
              results show that the high acute toxicity effects of organic
              halides were largely overlooked by the community in the shadow of
              the actively discussed lead toxicity. Still, the potential mass
              application of PSCs is not expected to cause significant
              environmental impact or health hazard in comparison with other
              sources of lead pollution associated with the common use of

  abstract  = "The description of the band gap of halide perovskites at the
               level of density functional theory (DFT) has been subject of
               several studies but still presents significant problems and
               deviations from experimental values. Various approaches have
               been proposed, including the use of system-specific hybrid
               functionals with a variable amount of exact exchange or the
               explicit inclusion of spin--orbit coupling (SOC) effects. In
               this work, we present a pragmatic recipe to compute the band gap
               of halide perovskites with a minimum average error. The recipe
               is tested on a set of 36 halide perovskites of the type ABX3 [A
               = Cs, methyl-ammonium (MA), and formamidinium (FA); B = Ge, Sn,
               and Pb; and X = Cl, Br, and I] for which experimental estimates
               of the band gap have been reported in the literature. Upon
               assessment of the accuracy of commonly used DFT functionals and
               the analysis of their performances based on error and
               statistical analysis, we suggest a strategy to compute band gaps
               in halide perovskites with a single functional. This is based on
               the use of the hybrid HSE06 functional where SOC is included
               exclusively for Pb-containing compounds. The results are
               rationalized in terms of the materials' chemical nature and are
               corroborated by the prediction of their expected efficiencies in
               solar cells. The calculated efficiencies from band gaps obtained
               with the proposed approach closely follow the experimental
               trend, demonstrating the importance of adopting a reliable but
               material-independent computational strategy to screen new halide
               perovskite materials for solar energy conversion.",

              the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction
              perovskite solar cells. They are typically built in the
              superstrate configuration, in which the device is illuminated
              from the substrate side. This limits the fabrication of the solar
              cell to transparent substrates, typically glass coated with a
              transparent conductive oxide (TCO), and adds constraints because
              the first subcell that is deposited on the substrate must contain
              the wide-bandgap perovskite. However, devices in the substrate
              configuration could potentially be fabricated on a large variety
              of opaque and inexpensive substrates, such as plastic and metal
              foils. Importantly, in the substrate configuration the
              narrow-bandgap subcell is deposited first, which allows for more
              freedom in the device design. In this work, we report
              perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells fabricated in the
              substrate configuration. As the substrate we use TCO-coated glass
              on which a solution-processed narrow-bandgap perovskite solar

              using vacuum sublimation, starting with the charge recombination
              layers, then the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell, and finishing
              with the transparent top TCO electrode. Proof-of-concept tandem
              solar cells show a maximum PCE of 20\%, which is still moderate
              compared to those of best-in-class devices realized in the

              potential for use in next-generation display technologies.
              However, scale-up will be challenging due to the requirement of
              very thin transport layers for high efficiencies, which often
              present spatial inhomogeneities from improper wetting and drying
              during solution processing. Here, we show how a thin Al2O3 layer
              grown by atomic layer deposition can be used to preferentially
              cover regions of imperfect hole transport layer deposition and
              form an intermixed composite with the organic transport layer,
              allowing hole conduction and injection to persist through the
              organic hole transporter. This has the dual effect of reducing
              nonradiative recombination at the heterojunction and improving
              carrier selectivity, which we infer to be due to the inhibition
              of direct contact between the indium tin oxide and perovskite
              layers. We observe an immediate improvement in electroluminescent
              external quantum efficiency in our p-i-n LEDs from an average of
              9.8\% to 13.5\%, with a champion efficiency of 15.0\%. The

               manufacturability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we have
               developed a one-step solution-coating procedure in which the
               hole-selective contact and perovskite light absorber
               spontaneously form, resulting in efficient inverted PSCs. We
               observed that phosphonic or carboxylic acids, incorporated into
               perovskite precursor solutions, self-assemble on the indium tin
               oxide substrate during perovskite film processing. They form a
               robust self-assembled monolayer as an excellent hole-selective
               contact while the perovskite crystallizes. Our approach solves
               wettability issues and simplifies device fabrication, advancing
               the manufacturability of PSCs. Our PSC devices with
               positive--intrinsic--negative (p-i-n) geometry show a power
               conversion efficiency of 24.5\% and retain >90\% of their
               initial efficiency after 1,200 h of operating at the maximum
               power point under continuous illumination. The approach shows
               good generality as it is compatible with different
               self-assembled monolayer molecular systems, perovskites,
               solvents and processing methods. Improving the manufacturability

               CQDs in solar cell applications. In this study, an investigation
               on the importance of the composition and sensitivity toward
               synthesis conditions was performed by adjusting concentrations
               and ratios of Ag and Bi precursors---first, by varying the ratio
               of Ag toward Bi precursors and, second, by varying the
               concentration of Ag with a constant ratio toward Bi precursors
               in the solution. Furthermore, elemental XPS studies and TEM
               imaging together with solar cell analysis indicated a strong
               correlation between the concentration of Ag precursor and the NC
               properties and, moreover, the solar cell properties based on
               these NCs. In short, a large amount of Ag precursor resulted in
               smaller Ag-rich NCs, which resulted in solar cells with high
               photovoltage but low photocurrent density, while a lower amount
               of Ag precursor resulted in larger NCs and solar cells with a
               lower photovoltage. The Ag:Bi:S ratio of 0.72:0.9:1 resulted in
               almost stoichiometric NCs but with a slight excess of Ag, which
               in turn resulted in solar cells with the highest performance.
               This work therefore gives insight into how the elemental
               composition and size of the NCs can be tuned by the precursor
               ratios and how this, in turn, affects the performance of the

              elements and a high absorption coefficient. In recent years,
              colloidal AgBiS2 NCs have typically been synthesized via the hot
              injection method using hexamethyldisilathiane (TMS) as the sulfur
              source. However, the cost of TMS is one of the biggest obstacles
              to large-scale synthesis of colloidal AgBiS2 NCs. Herein, we
              synthesized colloidal AgBiS2 NCs using oleylamine@sulfur (OLA-S)
              solution as the sulfur source instead of TMS and optimized the

              reaction injection temperature and the dosage of OLA-S, colloidal
              AgBiS2 NCs with adjustable size can be synthesized. Compared with

  abstract  = "Tin (II) sulphide (SnS), a direct band gap semiconductor
               compound, has recently received great attention due to its
               unique properties. Because of low cost, absence of toxicity, and
               good abundance in nature, it is becoming a candidate for future
               multifunctional devices particularly for light conversion
               applications. Although the current efficiencies are low, the
               cost-per-Watt is becoming competitive. At room temperature, SnS
               exhibits stable low-symmetric, double-layered orthorhombic
               crystal structure, having a = 0.4329, b = 1.1192, and c =
               0.3984nm as lattice parameters. These layer-structured materials
               are of interest in various device applications due to the
               arrangement of structural lattice with cations and anions. The
               layers of cations are separated only by van der Waals forces
               that provide intrinsically chemically inert surface without
               dangling bonds and surface density of states. As a result, there
               is no Fermi level pinning at the surface of the semiconductor.
               This fact leads to considerably high chemical and environmental
               stability. Further, the electrical and optical properties of SnS
               can be easily tailored by modifying the growth conditions or
               doping with suitable dopants without disturbing its crystal
               structure.In the last few decades, SnS has been synthesized and
               studied in the form of single-crystals and thin-films. Most of
               the SnS single-crystals have been synthesized by Bridgeman
               technique, whereas thin films have been developed using
               different physical as well as chemical deposition techniques.
               The synthesis or development of SnS structures in different
               forms including single-crystals and thin films, and their unique
               properties are reviewed here. The observed physical and chemical
               properties of SnS emphasize that this material could has novel
               applications in optoelectronics including solar cell devices,
               sensors, batteries, and also in biomedical sciences. These

               thermoelectric materials due to their exceptional electronic and
               thermal properties as well as great stability during operation.
               However, there is a lack of understanding about the fundamental
               relation between the reported high-defect crystal structure
               containing cation disorder and vacancies and the observed
               transport properties, which follow expectations for an ideal
               rock salt crystal structure. Here we have studied a series of
               undoped lead sulfide samples (Pb1- xS) with presumed small
               chemical variations. Crystallographic refinements of
               high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data give
               unphysically low lead occupancies (0.75-0.98), in contradiction

               mobility, and Seebeck coefficient, which show no signs of lead

               orientation parameters and anisotropic strain gives almost full
               lead occupancy and improved agreement factors. However,
               transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that there is
               no preferred orientation in this system. Instead it is the
               diffuse scattering due to directional correlated disorder in the
               structure that necessitates the additional parameters when
               modeling Bragg intensities. The present approach is a general

               solar cells (PSCs) generally exhibit undesired large

               coordinates with unbonded lead but also inhibits the migration

               nanosecond (ns) pulsed ultraviolet laser to reduce surface
               defects, such as dangling bonds, undesirable phases, and
               suboptimal stoichiometry. A careful control of laser energy and
               scanning speed improves the photophysical properties of the
               surface without compromising the thickness. Using laser
               polishing, a Voc of 1.21 V is achieved for planar PSCs with a
               triple cation composition, showing an improved perovskite/hole
               transport interface by mitigating surface recombination losses.

               is essential for their commercialization in emerging

               state-of-the-art first-principles calculations to achieve and

               (RP) lead/tin halide perovskites with fluorinated
               2-phenylethylammonium (PEA) spacer cations. It is found that the
               substitution of up to five F atoms in the phenyl ring makes C
               slightly positively charged due to ∼0.5e charge transfer to
               electronegative F. This leads to the formation of electric
               dipoles in the spacer cation region and polarization of the
               charge density. This improves the formation energy and enhances
               the stability of the layers. The charge transfer makes some of
               the C 2p orbitals partly empty so that they hybridize with F 2p
               orbitals near the conduction band minimum. This is interesting
               for the charge transport perpendicular to the layers. Our study
               further shows that changing the metal cations Pb with Sn does
               not affect the orientation of the cation molecules in the pure
               as well as chemically tuned RP layers whereas changing the
               halide ions I with Br has an impact on the orientation of the
               organic molecules. The calculated structures of the layers agree
               well with the available experimental results and suggest
               structures of some unexplored layers that would be interesting
               to fabricate. The calculated electronic structure and optical
               properties show that the absorption coefficient is high (∼105
               cm--1) for the layers having heavily fluorinated spacer cations.
               Furthermore, we find higher stability and a desirable lower
               direct band gap for Sn-based green perovskite layers compared to
               the Pb counterparts. Our results provide computational insight

               solutions, at low temperatures was developed via the substitution
               of anions from O(2-) to S(2-) (or Se(2-)) using bismuth oxyhalide

               treatment of BiOI particles with H2S or H2Se at surprisingly low
               temperatures of less than 150 °C and short reaction times of less

              state changes. Coulometric measurements correlated with X-ray
              absorption near-edge structure spectra of the active catalyst show
              that the nickel centers in activated films possess an average
              oxidation state of +3.6, indicating that a substantial proportion
              of nickel centers exist in a formal oxidation state of Ni(IV). In
              contrast, nickel centers in nonactivated films exist predominantly

              Diminished long-range ordering in catalyst films is due to their

               their simple, compact construction and wireless, self-contained

               description of their actuation mechanisms are not sufficiently

               magnitudes of the bending actuation of bilayered actuators is
               found and experimentally proven. At specific ratios of the

               and activation volume of the actuation mechanism, the actuation
               of the active layer will be put into a positive feedback mode
               where the actuation-induced bending of the cantilever structure
               triggers a compressive stress in a surface region of the active

              modification to realign the SnO2 conduction band upward to improve
              interfacial charge extraction; 2) passivating the buried
              perovskite surface, and 3) bridging between the SnO2 and

               allows only one active catalyst (NiOOH) to be present on the gold

               band gap range achievable with mixed-metal Pb–Sn perovskites also
               encompasses the 1.3 to 1.4 eV range that is theoretically ideal

               substituting between 0.001\% and 70\% of the Pb content with Sn.
               We reveal that a compositional range of “defectiveness” exists
               when Sn comprises between 0.5\% and 20\% of the metal content,
               but that the optoelectronic quality is restored for Sn content
               between 30–50\%. When only 1\% of Pb content is replaced by Sn,
               we find that photoconductivity, photoluminescence lifetime, and
               photoluminescence quantum efficiency are reduced by at least an
               order of magnitude, which reveals that a small concentration of
               Sn incorporation produces trap sites that promote non-radiative
               recombination in the material and limit photovoltaic performance.
               While these observations suggest that band gaps between 1.35 and

              the suitability of our AACVD-prepared 1.5 μm-thick CuSCN film in
              device applications, we demonstrate its incorporation as a hole
              transport layer (HTL) in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)
              perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our AACVD films result in devices
              with measured power conversion efficiencies of 10.4\%, which
              compares favorably with devices prepared using spin-coated CuSCN
              HTLs (12.6\%), despite the AACVD HTLs being an order of magnitude
              thicker than their spin-coated analogues. Improved reproducibility
              and decreased hysteresis were observed, owing to a combination of
              excellent film quality, high charge-carrier mobility, and
              favorable interface energetics. In addition to providing a
              fundamental insight into charge-carrier mobility in CuSCN, our
              work highlights the AACVD methodology as a scalable, versatile
              tool suitable for film deposition for use in optoelectronic
              devices.",

              use of passivation strategies based on lead iodide; however, these
              fail to passivate the entire surface of IR CQDs. Lead chloride
              passivated CQDs show improved passivation, but worse charge

              mobilities, but worse passivation. Here a mixed lead-halide (MPbX)
              ligand exchange is introduced that enables thorough surface
              passivation without compromising transport. MPbX-PbS CQDs exhibit
              properties that exceed the best features of single lead-halide PbS

              Estimation of the amount of elements in compound, not only their
              total concentration, is very important because only a part from
              total content of metal is absorbed by human organism. At the
              beginning, the total amount of elements in young barley was
              established as 16.69 ± 0.22 μg g−1 (RSD 1.36\%) for copper, 156.29
              ± 0.82 μg g−1 (RSD 0.52\%) for manganese, 155.35 ± 1.29 μg g−1
              (RSD 0.83\%) for zinc, 9.10 ± 0.21 μg g−1 (RSD 2.36\%) for
              molybdenum, and 0.35 ± 0.01 μg g−1 (RSD 1.63\%) for cobalt. The
              LOD of analyzed elements were as follows (μg L−1): Mn 0.59, Co
              0.05, Cu 0.33, Zn 1.2, and Mo 0.12. The LOQ of studied metals were
              as follows (μg L−1): Mn 1.9, Co 0.18, Cu 1.1, Zn 4.0, and Mo 1.4.
              After that, the most suitable solvents were identified. The
              determination of total and extractable amount of metals in young
              barley was carried out by standalone inductively coupled plasma
              mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In addition, a complementary analysis

              chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass
              spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS) method. It was confirmed that the

              different metal and metal species in comparison with commonly used
              solvents. The study indicated that extraction by using the NADES

               of thermoelectric materials is dictated by the dimensionless

               absolute temperature), which governs the Carnot efficiency for
               heat conversion. Enhancements above the generally high threshold
               value of 2.5 have important implications for commercial
               deployment, especially for compounds free of Pb and Te. Here we
               report an unprecedented ZT of 2.6 ± 0.3 at 923 K, realized in
               SnSe single crystals measured along the b axis of the
               room-temperature orthorhombic unit cell. This material also shows

               reduced ZT of 0.8 ± 0.2 along the a axis. We attribute the
               remarkably high ZT along the b axis to the intrinsically ultralow
               lattice thermal conductivity in SnSe. The layered structure of
               SnSe derives from a distorted rock-salt structure, and features
               anomalously high Grüneisen parameters, which reflect the
               anharmonic and anisotropic bonding. We attribute the

               perovskite thin films based on a multi-step vapor deposition

              attractive route to boost PSC efficiencies to above the
              single-junction Shockley-Queisser limit. However, commonly used
              tin-based narrow-bandgap perovskites have shorter carrier

              diffusion length of electrons. Adding 0.03 molar percent of
              cadmium ions into tin-perovskite precursors reduce the background

               of energy gap with the composition that can be directly compared
               with experiments is given. A particular situation is verified for
               x = 0.80, where the alloy is predicted to have a band gap of
               0.984, 0.033 eV lower than the gap of CsSnI3. Additionally, the

               to high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost

               grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite films severely
               affect their efficiencies and stabilities. Defect passivation is
               one of the effective strategies for improving photovoltaic
               efficiency and stability of PSCs via the decrease of
               non-radiative recombination losses caused by defect states.
               Herein, a multifunctional rhodamine B (RhB) molecule is firstly
               applied for synergistically passivating defects in the
               polycrystalline perovskite film. The carboxylic, diethyl amine
               and xanthene groups of RhB as Lewis bases inactivate the
               under-coordinated Pb2+, π-conjugation benzene ring is able to
               reduce the neutral iodine related defects, and its positively
               charged diethyl ammonium (C=N+) and Cl- anion neutralize the
               charged defects, ultimately healing these trap states. After RhB
               passivation, the inverted PSCs based on MAPbI3 exhibits a best
               PCE of 20.70 \% with extremely low hysteresis behavior (0.04 \%)
               in comparison to the control PSCs (PCE of 18.79 \% with high
               hysteresis index of 1.38 \%). Meanwhile, the unpackaged device
               with RhB displays better stability owing to the hydrophobic
               phenyl groups of RhB hindering the decomposition of perovskite
               film. These results demonstrate that the synergistic passivation
               of multifunctional RhB in this work exhibits a novel strategy to

               comparatively cheap photovoltaic materials, but their wide
               bandgaps and downshifted valence band edges limit their
               performance as light absorbers in solar cells. Herein, a strategy
               is introduced to tune the optoelectronic properties of
               AgaBibIa+3b by partial anionic substitution with the sulfide
               dianion. A consistent narrowing of the bandgap by 0.1 eV and an
               upshift of the valence band edge by 0.1?0.3 eV upon modification
               with sulfide are demonstrated for AgBiI4, Ag2BiI5, Ag3BiI6, and
               AgBi2I7 compositions. Solar cells based on silver bismuth
               sulfoiodides embedded into a mesoporous TiO2

               poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] hole-transporting

               materials, mainly due to enhancements in the photocurrent by up
               to 48\%. A power conversion efficiency of 5.44 ± 0.07\% (Jsc =

              solar cells normally occurs by heating the underlying substrate.
              Conversion tends to occur near the top of the film, where solvent
              is lost, and unwanted preheating of reactants occurs near the
              substrate before the reaction. Li et al. show that the use of a
              surrounding heat transfer oil (anisole) leads to more rapid and
              even heating, removes solvent, and avoids air and water
              contamination effects. The larger grains and more uniform films
              led a much greater retention of efficiency in moving from
              small-area to large-area devices. —PDS Liquid medium annealing
              creates a robust microenvironment and constant heat field to
              fabricate durable perovskite solar cells. Solution processing of
              semiconductors is highly promising for the high-throughput
              production of cost-effective electronics and optoelectronics.
              Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device
              applications, challenges remain in the development of high-quality
              materials with simultaneously improved processing reproducibility
              and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium annealing (LMA)
              technology that creates a robust chemical environment and constant
              heating field to modulate crystal growth over the entire film. Our
              method produces films with high crystallinity, fewer defects,
              desired stoichiometry, and overall film homogeneity. The resulting
              perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yield a stabilized power output of
              24.04\% (certified 23.7\%, 0.08 cm2) and maintain 95\% of their
              initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of
              operation. In addition, the 1-cm2 PSCs exhibit a stabilized power
              output of 23.15\% (certified PCE 22.3\%) and keep 90\% of their
              initial PCE after 1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their
              feasibility for scalable fabrication. LMA is less climate
              dependent and produces devices in-house with negligible
              performance variance year round. This method thus opens a new and
              effective avenue to improving the quality of perovskite films and
              photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.",

               solar cells with a maximum certified efficiency of 22.1\%.
               However, there are only a handful of reports on larger area
               modules, where efficiencies drop with increasing use of the
               active area. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a technology used
               in many industrial applications demonstrating potential for scale
               up. We used a CVD process to fabricate MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 based
               solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to
               15.6\% (MAI, 0.09 cm2) and 5 × 5 cm modules with 9.5\% (FAI,
               5-cell modules, total active area 8.8 cm2) and 9.0\% (FAI, 6-cell
               modules, total active area 12 cm2). To further investigate
               scaling issues, we fabricated modules using an established MAPbI3
               solution process, and demonstrated maximum PCEs of 18.3\% (MAI,
               0.1 cm2), 14.6\% (MAI, 1 cm2 single cells), and 8.5\% at 5 × 5 cm
               (MAI, 6-cell module, total active area 15.4 cm2). The solution
               processed cells performed better than CVD cells when comparing
               PCEs determined from J–V measurements, but the steady state power
               of solution processed solar cells decreased quickly with
               increasing area. This decrease in power was correlated with rapid
               heating of the solar cells under 1 sun illumination, with a
               pronounced drop in performance at the phase transition
               temperature of MAPbI3. In contrast, FAPbI3 CVD grown solar
               modules maintained much of their PCEs transitioning from J–V
               measurements to the steady state operating conditions (1 sun),
               suggesting that the FAI based CVD process may outperform MAI

              fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of its
              solvent-free characteristic, precise control of film thickness,
              and compatibility with large-scale production. Nevertheless, the
              power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs fabricated by vacuum
              evaporation lags behind that of solution-processed PSCs. Here, we
              report a Cl-containing alloy-mediated sequential vacuum
              evaporation approach to fabricate perovskite films. The presence
              of Cl in the alloy facilitates organic ammonium halide diffusion
              and the subsequent perovskite conversion reaction, leading to
              homogeneous pinhole-free perovskite films with few defects. The
              resulting PSCs yield a PCE of 24.42\%, 23.44\% (certified 22.6\%),

              semiconductors have, over the past two decades, been utilized as
              energy-efficient sources of lighting. However, fabrication of
              these devices typically relies on expensive high-temperature and
              high-vacuum processes, rendering them uneconomical for use in
              large-area displays. Here, we report high-brightness
              light-emitting diodes based on solution-processed organometal
              halide perovskites. We demonstrate electroluminescence in the
              near-infrared, green and red by tuning the halide compositions in
              the perovskite. In our infrared device, a thin 15 nm layer of
              CH3NH3PbI(3-x)Cl(x) perovskite emitter is sandwiched between
              larger-bandgap titanium dioxide (TiO2) and
              poly(9,9'-dioctylfluorene) (F8) layers, effectively confining
              electrons and holes in the perovskite layer for radiative
              recombination. We report an infrared radiance of 13.2 W sr(-1)
              m(-2) at a current density of 363 mA cm(-2), with highest external
              and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.76\% and 3.4\%,
              respectively. In our green light-emitting device with an
              ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/F8/Ca/Ag structure, we achieved a
              luminance of 364 cd m(-2) at a current density of 123 mA cm(-2),
              giving external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.1\% and
              0.4\%, respectively. We show, using photoluminescence studies,
              that radiative bimolecular recombination is dominant at higher
              excitation densities. Hence, the quantum efficiencies of the
              perovskite light-emitting diodes increase at higher current
              densities. This demonstration of effective perovskite
              electroluminescence offers scope for developing this unique class

               can be inhibited by alloying with methylammonium-based (MA)
               perovskite, the underlying mechanism is largely unexplored. In

               understand the principles for maintaining pure perovskite phase,
               which is essential to device optimization. We demonstrate that
               the best composition for a perfect α-phase perovskite without

               carrier lifetime as long as 11.0 μs, which is over 20 times of

               attention owing to their remarkable performance and low
               processing cost, particularly for solar cells. However, for
               perovskite light-emitting diodes, non-radiative charge
               recombination has limited the electroluminescence efficiency.
               Here we demonstrate perovskite–polymer bulk heterostructure
               light-emitting diodes exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of
               up to 20.1\% (at current densities of 0.1–1 mA cm−2). The
               light-emitting diode emissive layer comprises
               quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskites
               and an insulating polymer. Photogenerated excitations migrate
               from quasi-2D to lower-energy sites within 1 ps, followed by
               radiative bimolecular recombination in the 3D regions. From
               near-unity external photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and
               transient kinetics of the emissive layer with and without

               pathways to be effectively eliminated, consistent with optical
               models giving near 100\% internal quantum efficiencies. Although
               the device brightness and stability (T50 = 46 h in air at peak
               external quantum efficiency) require further improvement, our

               performance (>22\%) and low temperature solution processability
               (<150 °C). Current solution process involves application of a
               large amount of toxic solvents, such as chlorobenzene, which is
               heavily employed in both the perovskite layer and the hole
               transport layer (HTL) deposition. Herein, this study employs
               green solvent of ethyl acetate for engineering efficient
               perovskite and HTL layers, which enables a synergic interface
               (perovskite/HTL) optimization. A champion efficiency of 19.43\%

               responsible for the PL behavior of in-situ annealed CsSnBr3
               films. In-situ annealing was also capable of extending carriers
               lifetime and reducing trap density, and leading to the occurrence
               of the suppressed “self-doping” of Sn4+ and reduction of acceptor
               states. Meanwhile, the improved crystal quality of the CsSnBr3
               nanocrystals should be closely related to the enhanced charge
               carriers dynamics and improved PL performance. The PeLED with 85
               °C in-situ annealed CsSnBr3 emitting layer demonstrated optimal

               low-bandgap absorbers for all-perovskite tandem solar cells that

               significant barrier to higher performance and stability is the
               ready oxidation of tin, commonly mitigated by various additives
               whose impact is still poorly understood for mixed tin-lead
               perovskites. Here, the effects of the commonly used SnF2 additive
               are revealed for FA0.83Cs0.17SnxPb1?xI3 perovskites across the
               full compositional lead-tin range and SnF2 percentages of
               0.1?20\% of precursor tin content. SnF2 addition causes a
               significant reduction in the background hole density associated

               decreased energetic disorder, reduced Burstein?Moss shifts, and

               technique called theoretical image fitting analysis-axisymmetric

               strategies and experimental setups, contact angles can be
               measured with an accuracy of less than 0.2 degrees. Contact
               angles and surface tensions measured from drops with no apex,
               i.e., by means of ADSA-NA and TIFA-AI, were considerably less
               scattered than those from complete drops with apex. ADSA-NA was
               also used to explore sources of improvement in contact angle
               resolution. It was found that using an accurate value of surface
               tension as an input enhances the accuracy of contact angle
               measurements.",

               hindering their application in practice. One is the toxicity of
               metal lead and the other is the stability of the compound.
               Herein, the structure, stability, electronic properties, and
               optical properties of six novel perovskites, MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B =
               Pb, Sn, Ge) and lead-less MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50,
               0.75), have been investigated employing the density functional
               theory method. The effects of the substitution of Sn/Ge for Pb
               and Sn-doping on the stability, electronic, and optical
               properties were also considered. The calculation of formation
               enthalpy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that
               the six studied compounds possess good thermodynamic stability.
               The band structure, partial density of states, Bader charge
               analysis, electron localization function, and carrier's effective
               mass were simulated for evaluating the electronic properties of
               the six perovskites. The metal tin completely or partially
               replaces metal Pb of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites, reduces the band
               gap of the system and improves carrier's transport ability. The
               dielectric constants ε(ω), optical absorption coefficient α(ω),
               energy loss L(ω), refractivity index n(ω) and reflectivity R(ω)

               the optical absorption range and optical absorption intensity in
               the UV-vis region. Ge-based perovskite has very similar
               electronic and optical properties to the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound,
               but is lead-free. Therefore, among the six studied perovskites,

               circuit voltage (Voc) of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) PSCs
               from 1.06 to 1.16 V and their power conversion efficiency (PCE)
               from 18.7\% to 20.1\%. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low
               energy ion scattering data show NMA is located at grain surfaces,
               not the bulk. Scanning electron microscopy shows combining NMA
               addition with solvent assisted annealing creates large grains
               that span the active layer. Steady state and transient
               photoluminescence data show NMA suppresses non-radiative

               passivation of grain surfaces. Increasing the NMA concentration

               a simple electrochemical deposition method for quickly and evenly

               increasing thickness and decreasing surface roughness of the NiOx
               film are beneficial for light transmission. The optimal condition
               for preparing NiOx films is achieved by adjusting the deposition
               time at a certain applied current density, which exhibits
               excellent optical transmittance and suitable thickness and band

              nanocrystals, the large-scale synthesis of CsPbX3 nanocrystals
              remains an outstanding challenge. In this paper, nanocrystals of
              CsPbBr3 were subjected to one-pot synthesis in octane by using a
              precursor with a high concentration. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were
              obtained in octane dispersion as well as in the precipitation. All
              obtained nanocrystals were in the CsPbBr3 nanocubes with uniform
              morphologies and average size of 7.8 nm, and featured the same
              emission peak and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), which
              indicated that the concentration of the precursor did not
              influence the nucleation of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. This result
              implied a large-scale synthesis of the nanocrystals. Following
              this, ~ 1 g of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were obtained only in the
              10-mL octane solution when the concentration of PbBr2 was up to
              0.3 mol/L. This one-pot process was suitable for the large-scale
              and cost-effective synthesis of CsPbX3 nanocrystals. Besides, the
              obtained CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were used as probes of the [Zn2+]

              Herein, we report the simple synthesis and use of α-Ni(OH)2
              nanocrystals as a remarkably active and stable OER catalyst in

  abstract  = "Tin (II) sulphide (SnS), a direct band gap semiconductor
               compound, has recently received great attention due to its unique
               properties. Because of low cost, absence of toxicity, and good
               abundance in nature, it is becoming a candidate for future
               multifunctional devices particularly for light conversion
               applications. Although the current efficiencies are low, the
               cost-per-Watt is becoming competitive. At room temperature, SnS
               exhibits stable low-symmetric, double-layered orthorhombic
               crystal structure, having a = 0.4329, b = 1.1192, and c =
               0.3984nm as lattice parameters. These layer-structured materials
               are of interest in various device applications due to the
               arrangement of structural lattice with cations and anions. The
               layers of cations are separated only by van der Waals forces that
               provide intrinsically chemically inert surface without dangling
               bonds and surface density of states. As a result, there is no
               Fermi level pinning at the surface of the semiconductor. This
               fact leads to considerably high chemical and environmental
               stability. Further, the electrical and optical properties of SnS
               can be easily tailored by modifying the growth conditions or
               doping with suitable dopants without disturbing its crystal
               structure.In the last few decades, SnS has been synthesized and
               studied in the form of single-crystals and thin-films. Most of
               the SnS single-crystals have been synthesized by Bridgeman
               technique, whereas thin films have been developed using different
               physical as well as chemical deposition techniques. The synthesis
               or development of SnS structures in different forms including
               single-crystals and thin films, and their unique properties are
               reviewed here. The observed physical and chemical properties of
               SnS emphasize that this material could has novel applications in
               optoelectronics including solar cell devices, sensors, batteries,
               and also in biomedical sciences. These aspects are also
               discussed.",

              semiconductor nanomaterials hitherto unreachable by a scalable
              processing pathway. Firstly, the use of metal dithiocarbamate
              precursors to produce bulk alloys in the series Pb1-x Sn x S (0 ≤
              x ≤ 1) by thermolysis is demonstrated. The bulk powders are
              characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), Raman
              spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy
              dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. It was found that there is a
              transition from cubic structures for the Pb-rich alloys including
              the end compound, PbS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) to layered orthorhombic
              structures for Sn-rich alloys and the end compound SnS (0.5 ≤ x ≤
              1.0). A smooth elemental progression from lead-rich to tin-rich
              monochalcogenides across the series of materials is observed.
              Liquid phase exfoliation was applied to produce two dimensional
              (2D) nanosheets for a mixed Pb1-x Sn x S alloy (where x = 0.8) in
              1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) using the synthetic bulk powder as
              starting material. The nanosheet products were characterized by
              SEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high angle annular dark
              field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF STEM).
              First principle calculations of Pb1-x Sn x S alloys show that the
              Sn content x modifies the size of the band gap by several 100 meV
              and that x changes the gap type from indirect in SnS to direct in
              Pb0.2Sn0.8S. These results are supported by UV-Vis spectroscopy of
              exfoliated Pb0.2Sn0.8S. The method employed demonstrates a new,
              scalable, processing pathway which can potentially be used to
              synthesize a range of synthetic layered structures that can be
              exfoliated to as-yet unaccessed 2D materials with tunable

              conversion to cyclic carbonates starting from epoxides has been
              widely explored in the last years. Nevertheless, conducting this
              reaction under mild and sustainable conditions is still a
              challenging task. Herein we present the use of choline-salt based
              eutectic mixtures as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with
              epoxides to give cyclic carbonates. Choline chloride and choline
              iodide have been coupled with various hydrogen bond donors (HBDs),
              mainly cheap and bio-based carboxylic acids and polyols, to form
              two classes of eutectic mixtures. Very good yields were achieved
              under mild conditions (80 °C in 7–22 h) for various terminal
              epoxides, with both classes of catalysts. While a pressure of 0.4
              MPa of CO2 is required to obtain appreciable conversions using
              choline chloride-based mixture, atmospheric pressure of CO2
              (balloon) has been successfully used with choline iodide-based
              mixtures. Furthermore, the catalysts could be recycled without
              appreciable loss of the catalytic activity. The improved catalytic
              performance of both choline-based eutectic mixtures is attributed
              to the synergistic activity of the halide, responsible for the
              opening of the epoxy-ring, and the HBD that has a role in the

              nucleation stage, remaining on the crystal surface and ultimately
              passivating the resulting perovskite films, but also releases the
              micro-strain generated during the film growth. Furthermore, TNPD
              could lower the defect density (Sn4+ amount) by screening the
              perovskite against oxygen and by synergistically bonding with
              undercoordinated Sn/Pb on the surface. Finally, a high VOC of 0.85
              V is obtained, corresponding to a voltage deficit of 0.41 V using
              a perovskite absorber with a bandgap of 1.26 eV, and a high PCE
              (20.35\%) reported so far for Pb-Sn PSCs. Moreover, the stability
              of the TNPD-incorporated device is significantly improved, and the
              PCE maintains 50\% of the initial value after about 1000 h storage
              in glovebox without encapsulated, in comparison to that of the
              control device (about 700 h, maintaining 30\% of the initial
              value).",

               catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have
               driven intensive research into the use of non-noble metal
               catalysts in recent years. As the most promising non-noble metal
               catalysts for PEMFC oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), metal/N/C
               class of catalysts has been extensively explored. Earlier efforts
               (1964–2004) were mainly focused on the exploration of various
               synthesis routes and the investigation of active site mechanisms.
               During recent years (2005–2010), great progress in the
               development of these types of non-noble metal catalysts in real
               PEMFC environments has been achieved both in terms of catalytic
               activity and stability. From 2011 to present, several new
               synthetic approaches have been explored to produce highly dense
               catalytically active sites decorated within micropores using
               rationally designed zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and
               porous organic polymers (POPs). Currently, the most active
               non-noble metal catalysts are derived using this method and are
               able to deliver a kinetic volumetric current density of 450 A/cm3
               at 0.8 V under fuel cell operating conditions. These results are
               superior to the US DOE 2020 target of 300 A/cm3. In terms of fuel
               cell maximum power density, the best non-noble metal catalysts
               for cathodes can achieve results as high as 0.98 W/cm2 and 0.41
               W/cm2 with feeds of pure O2 and air respectively. In terms of
               stability, some non-noble metal catalysts have remained stable
               for over 1000 h with only minor degradation under PEMFC
               conditions. Nonetheless, activity and stability still remain
               major challenges for non-noble metal catalysts when compared to
               Pt-based ones in PEMFCs. Improvements in the structure of both
               catalysts and catalyst layers are urgently needed to realize the
               activity targets established for automobile fuel cell
               applications as well as the US DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cell (H\&FC)
               program. In the long term and the sustainable commercialization
               of fuel cells, replacing Pt-based catalysts with non-noble metal
               catalysts is, in the present authors’ opinion, the most
               sustainable solution. Therefore, further intensive research into
               fundamental studies is critical to uncovering the workings of
               active site mechanisms. Once controllable design and synthesize
               of non-noble metal catalysts with high active site densities and
               utilization can be achieved, the goal of cost-effective,
               non-noble metal catalysts in automobile fuel cells can become
               reality. © 2018",

               structure comprising a Ni nanohoneycomb active layer, backed by a
               solid constraining layer of Ni, can exhibit bending in an
               electrolyte environment when a voltage is applied across the
               cantilever and electrolyte. In this work, a multi-scale,
               multi-field simulation approach is used to model such an
               electrochemical actuation behavior. Specifically, molecular
               dynamics simulations with reactive force-field potentials and a
               modified charge-equilibrium (QEq) method are used to calculate
               the surface stress built up in Ni(1 0 0) surface in contact with
               water electrolyte due to a voltage applied across the interface,
               as a result of capacitive charging of the double layer in the
               contacting electrolyte as well as redox reaction of the Ni
               surface. The calculated surface stress is then used as input in a
               meso-scale finite-element (FE) model to compute the actuating
               stress set up in a single hexagonal unit cell of the Ni
               nanohoneycomb structure. The single-unit actuating stress is
               eventually used in a continuum FE model at a larger scale, to
               calculate the bending of an entire bilayered cantilever which
               replicates experimental conditions. The actuation deflection of
               the bilayered nanohoneycomb nickel is predicted to be 41.4 μm at
               0.43 V vs the point of zero charge (PZC), which corresponds to
               ∼0.48 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and this is in
               excellent agreement with the experimental value of 45–62 μm at a
               similar voltage vs SCE. This is the first successful attempt to
               simulate the electrochemical actuation of a real-sized,

              In order to normalize the electrochemical output currents, the Ni

              using an oxalate-based method after the template was released. The

               charge-transfer (MCT) model. In this work, we show that combining

               provides useful insights into the physics of emerging efficient
               OSCs. We studied nine different donor–acceptor systems, wherein
               the power conversion efficiency ranges from 4.4 to 14.1\% and
               ΔVOC varies from 0.55 to 0.95 V. For these state-of-the-art
               devices, we calculated the ΔVOC using the radiative limit and the
               MCT model. Furthermore, we combined both models to derive new
               insights on the origin of radiative voltage losses (ΔVrad) in

               disorder by revisiting the spectral regions of interest for OSCs.
               Our findings are in agreement with the expected relationship of

               of Pb-based perovskites and the lack of manufacturing technology
               in air limits the commercialization of perovskite-based
               photodetectors. Tin halide perovskite (THP) is a promising
               candidate to replace Pb-based perovskites due to its low toxicity
               and potential commercialization. However, THP suffers poor
               stability in air because Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+. This
               “self-doping” effect not only degrades device performance
               rapidly, but also makes it difficult to fabricate THP-based
               devices in air. Here, Pb-free Sn-based 2D perovskite PEA2SnI4
               films with tin fluoride (SnF2) additive are prepared in air using
               a nitrogen quenching hot casting method. The photodetectors with

               and BiI3 have been frequently suggested as promising alternatives

               Here, we investigated (AgI)x(BiI3)y thin films with
               stoichiometric ratios (x/y) of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 produced
               via a low-temperature (<100 °C) spin coating process from
               AgI/BiI3 solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. Several critical
               observations on the basis of ultrafast broadband UV–vis transient
               absorption spectroscopy and photocurrent spectroscopy were made
               for these Ag–Bi–I materials, which will have a considerable
               impact on their photovoltaic performance: Their carrier
               recombination kinetics were independent of the initial carrier
               number density over the range of 1.3–6.6 × 1017 cm–3 and well
               approximated by a monoexponential decay with a rate constant krec
               in the range of 2.0–4.3 × 108 s–1, which is consistent with
               trap-mediated charge-carrier recombination. Moreover, pronounced
               coherent phonon dynamics was observed for all of these
               (AgI)x(BiI3)y compounds, thereby suggesting strong
               electron–phonon coupling, which will favor charge-carrier
               localization and nonradiative carrier recombination, in agreement
               with the virtually absent photoluminescence of these materials.
               In addition, Fourier-transform step-scan photocurrent
               spectroscopy (FTPS) on AgBi2I7 provided an Urbach energy of 70
               meV and found indications for deep defects (0.6 eV below the band
               gap), which was also consistent with a trap-mediated
               recombination mechanism. A combination of all of these effects is
               likely responsible for the still quite low light-harvesting
               performance of this class of materials, which has been reported
               to show photovoltaic conversion efficiencies (PCEs) below 5\%.
               Finally, for “AgI-rich” compounds (3:1, 2:1), we found a
               substantial separate contribution of carrier loss processes
               through ultrafast relaxation in AgI domains with time constants
               of 0.73 and 2.4 ps.",

  abstract  = "Abstract In the search for nontoxic alternatives to lead-halide
               perovskites, bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) has emerged as a promising
               contender. BiOI is air-stable for over three months, demonstrates
               promising early-stage photovoltaic performance and, importantly,
               is predicted from calculations to tolerate vacancy and antisite
               defects. Here, whether BiOI tolerates point defects is
               experimentally investigated. BiOI thin films are annealed at a
               low temperature of 100 °C under vacuum (25 Pa absolute pressure).
               There is a relative reduction in the surface atomic fraction of
               iodine by over 40\%, reduction in the surface bismuth fraction by
               over 5\%, and an increase in the surface oxygen fraction by over
               45\%. Unexpectedly, the Bi 4f7/2 core level position, Fermi level
               position, and valence band density of states of BiOI are not
               significantly changed. Further, the charge-carrier lifetime,
               photoluminescence intensity, and the performance of the
               vacuum-annealed BiOI films in solar cells remain unchanged. The
               results show BiOI to be electronically and optoelectronically
               robust to percent-level changes in surface composition. However,
               from photoinduced current transient spectroscopy measurements, it
               is found that the as-grown BiOI films have deep traps located
               ≈0.3 and 0.6 eV from the band edge. These traps limit the
               charge-carrier lifetimes of BiOI, and future improvements in the
               performance of BiOI photovoltaics will need to focus on
               identifying their origin. Nevertheless, these deep traps are
               three to four orders of magnitude less concentrated than the
               surface point defects induced through vacuum annealing. The
               charge-carrier lifetimes of the BiOI films are also orders of
               magnitude longer than if these surface defects were recombination
               active. This work therefore shows BiOI to be robust against
               processing conditions that lead to percent-level iodine-,
               bismuth-, and oxygen-related surface defects. This will simplify
               and reduce the cost of fabricating BiOI-based electronic devices,
               and stands in contrast to the defect-sensitivity of traditional
               covalent semiconductors.",

               material with superior ferroelectric characteristics. However,
               the DIPAB continuous film, which is essential to explore its
               application potential, is challenging because its crystallization
               kinetics favors island-like microcrystalline growth. In this
               work, the continuous and uniform deposition of organic
               ferroelectric DIPAB film on a single crystalline Si(100)
               substrate is demonstrated by a thermal evaporation process.
               Structural and optical studies reveal that the film is c-axis
               oriented with an optical bandgap of 3.52 eV. The topographic
               image displays well-connected grain-like surface morphology with
               ∼2 nm roughness. The ferroelectric domain studies illustrate the
               in-plane orientation of the domains, which is in accordance with
               c-axis oriented film where polarization is along the in-plane
               b-axis. The phase and amplitude responses of the domains display
               hysteresis and butterfly characteristics, respectively and
               thereby endorse the ferroelectric nature of the film.
               Importantly, it is demonstrated that the DIPAB film exhibits
               remarkable self-powered UV-Vis photodetector characteristics with
               responsivity of 0.66 mA W−1 and detectivity of 2.20 × 109 Jones

              negative Poisson's ratios have attracted intensive interest, but
              it is very rare to have both ferroelasticity and negative
              Poisson's ratios in a single material. Directional positive and
              negative Poisson's ratios in a switchable ferroelastic dielectric
              may enable non-destructive readout in ferroelastic data storage.
              Herein, we propose 14 kinds of stable 2D semiconductors: AB
              monolayers (A = Sc, Y, La; B = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) based on
              first-principles calculations. The band gaps of AB monolayers
              cover a wide range from 0.69 eV to 2.15 eV. Mechanical analysis
              reveals that these materials are flexible and 12 of 14 are
              predicted to possess an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR).
              Moreover, 10 of these 14 systems possess an out-of-plane NPR. More
              encouragingly, all AB monolayers are identified as 2D ferroelastic

              ferroelastic switching barriers, mechanical properties and
              electronic structures of these materials are discussed in detail.
              Such outstanding properties make the AB monolayers very promising

              Herein, we report on large-area light-absorbing perovskite films

              decreasing the total pressure in the evaporation environment, the

              rate by 8 times faster and thereby produce an extremely dense,
              uniform, and full-coverage perovskite thin film. The resulting
              planar perovskite solar cells can achieve an impressive power
              conversion efficiency up to 19.00\% with an average efficiency of
              17.38 ± 0.70\% for 32 devices with an area of 5 × 2 mm, 13.91\%

               cell applications. In this study, an investigation on the
               importance of the composition and sensitivity toward synthesis
               conditions was performed by adjusting concentrations and ratios
               of Ag and Bi precursors—first, by varying the ratio of Ag toward
               Bi precursors and, second, by varying the concentration of Ag
               with a constant ratio toward Bi precursors in the solution.
               Furthermore, elemental XPS studies and TEM imaging together with
               solar cell analysis indicated a strong correlation between the
               concentration of Ag precursor and the NC properties and,
               moreover, the solar cell properties based on these NCs. In short,
               a large amount of Ag precursor resulted in smaller Ag-rich NCs,
               which resulted in solar cells with high photovoltage but low
               photocurrent density, while a lower amount of Ag precursor
               resulted in larger NCs and solar cells with a lower photovoltage.
               The Ag:Bi:S ratio of 0.72:0.9:1 resulted in almost stoichiometric
               NCs but with a slight excess of Ag, which in turn resulted in
               solar cells with the highest performance. This work therefore
               gives insight into how the elemental composition and size of the

               cells (PCSs) have made great progress recently. However, the
               serious Sn (II)/I vacancy defects within perovskite film due to
               poor thermodynamic stability and strong reaction activity of Sn
               (II) still limit the efficiency and stability of Sn–Pb-based
               PSCs. In this work, we proposed a PEAAc post-treatment method to
               mitigate successfully this problem. Sn–Pb-based perovskite films
               were post-treated by phenethylamine acetate (PEAAc) to form a 2D
               layered structure on the surface of 3D perovskite film, which
               passivates the defects on the surface and at the grain boundary
               of the 3D perovskite and blocks the erosion of water and oxygen.
               In addition, the coordinate energy of Ac– with Sn2+/Pb2+ is
               larger than I–, which effectively inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+
               and suppresses the ionic migration. Besides, the introduction of
               PEAAc also modifies the band energy alignment at the perovskite
               interface. Benefiting from these roles of PEAAc, the photovoltaic
               performance and long-term stability of the device are largely
               improved. As a result, the best device after PEAAc passivation
               achieves the open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.79 V, the
               short-circuit current density (JSC) of 29.31 mA/cm2, and the fill
               factor (FF) of 0.75, and thus the PCE of 18.36\% (the champion
               PCE of control device is only 14.75\%). In addition, the PSCs
               treated by PEAAc can still maintain 60\% of the initial

               conversion efficiency (PCE) under 1 Sun using thick absorber
               films made on mesoporous electron-transport layers. However, in

               interlayer distance. This compression behavior is coincidal with
               the compression of other well-known layered compounds (graphite
               and boron nitride) but differs significantly from the compression
               of other MS2 compounds, making it clear that SnS2 presents a
               unique and interesting case in the field of metal
               dichalcogenides. The compression leads to a significant increase
               in S···S interlayer interaction which in turn results in a change
               in the electronic structure, documented through DFT band
               structure calculations. The calculated narrowing of the band gap
               is supported by a significant, reversible color change of the
               single crystal. At 20 GPa, the size of the band gap has decreased
               from 2.15 to 0.88 eV, and band gap closure is predicted to occur
               at 33 GPa.",

               complexation with organic (formamidinium iodide) and inorganic

               improved film crystallinity. Additionally, it is demonstrated
               that DMPU-based solvent system can further inhibit the oxidation

              comparative study under moisture conditions with respect to vacuum
              and nitrogen treatments has assessed the occurrence of an
              intrinsic dynamic exchange of protons between the organic cations

              stability, for which the presence of water molecules is not
              mandatory. This mutual interaction produces defects inside the
              material and volatile species, such as HI, CH3NH2 or MAI, with an

               integration of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and
               solution-based crystallization methods have been employed widely
               to this end. Despite the versatility of the solution approach,
               device fabrication using typical “top-down” lithography is
               generally incompatible with as-prepared OIHPs films because of
               the low stability of perovskites to polar solvents involved in
               the lithographic process. Moreover, solution-prepared perovskites
               usually exhibit irregular surface roughness, implying the
               existence of randomly oriented crystal domains with a large
               density of grain boundaries, which are ultimately detrimental to
               the material properties. Here, we report a patterning of
               CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films using a photolithographically
               fabricated cross-linked copolymer template on Si or SiO2
               substrates via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.
               Perovskite patterning is accomplished by growing PbI2 precursor
               layers selectively on template patterns and subsequently
               converting to MAPbI3 using CH3NH3I (MAI) in the vapor phase. We
               confirm that [0001]-oriented PbI2 nanoplatelets nucleate
               primarily on a Si or SiO2 surface and grow by surface diffusion
               from a polymer surface. The MAPbI3 conversion process preserves
               the original pattern morphology through the vapor–solid
               intercalation of MAI. Prototype photodetector arrays based on
               MAPbI3 patterns are also demonstrated. Our results highlight the

               batteries, has been the subject of much recent interest due to
               its efficacy as an oxygen evolution catalyst. Despite extensive
               study over more than a century, however, many outstanding
               questions remain surrounding both the structure and the activity
               of NiOx. Further compounding this ambiguity is the recent finding
               that much of the previous experimental work on NiOx may have been
               influenced by incidental doping. Here, we report a computational
               study of the two simplest members of the NiOx family: β-Ni(OH)2
               and β-NiOOH. Using DFT+U calculations, we first identify a
               β-NiOOH structure with a staggered arrangement of intercalated
               protons that is more consistent with experimental crystal
               structures of β-NiOOH than previously proposed geometries. Next,
               by conducting a thorough study of various initial spin
               configurations of this β-NiOOH structure, we found that a
               low-spin d7 Ni3+ configuration is always favored, which suggests
               a Jahn–Teller distortion, rather than disproportionation,
               explains the different Ni–O bond distances found in experiment.
               G0W0 calculations performed on β-Ni(OH)2 and β-NiOOH reveal
               electronic structures consistent with previous experimental
               results. Lastly, calculations of various low-index surface
               energies of both β-Ni(OH)2 and β-NiOOH demonstrate that the (001)

               single crystals with highly reactive surfaces have long been

               diminish rapidly during the crystal growth process as a result of
               surface energy minimization. The crystal planes of nickel

               to water vapor at room temperature and (ii) these phase changes
               are fully reversed when the material is subsequently dried. The
               reversible formation of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O followed by
               (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O (upon long exposure times) was observed using

               “solvent engineering”, single crystals, and state-of-the-art
               solar cells. In contrast to water vapor, the presence of liquid
               water results in the irreversible decomposition of MAPI to form
               PbI2. MAPI changes from dark brown to transparent on hydration;
               the precise optical constants of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O formed on single
               crystals were determined, with a bandgap at 3.1 eV. Using the
               single-crystal optical constants and thin-film ellipsometry
               measurements, the time-dependent changes to MAPI films exposed to
               moisture were modeled. The results suggest that the monohydrate
               phase forms independent of the depth in the film, suggesting
               rapid transport of water molecules along grain boundaries.
               Vapor-phase hydration of an unencapsulated solar cell (initially
               Jsc ≈ 19 mA cm–2 and Voc ≈ 1.05 V at 1 sun) resulted in more than
               a 90\% drop in short-circuit photocurrent and ∼200 mV loss in
               open-circuit potential; however, these losses were fully reversed
               after the device was exposed to dry nitrogen for 6 h. Hysteresis
               in the current–voltage characteristics was significantly
               increased after this dehydration, which may be related to changes
               in the defect density and morphology of MAPI following
               recrystallization from the hydrate. Based on our observations, we
               suggest that irreversible decomposition of MAPI in the presence
               of water vapor only occurs significantly once a grain has been
               fully converted to the monohydrate phase.",

              requirements. Various technological approaches have been proposed
              to overcome the instability problem, which, while delivering
              appreciable incremental improvements, are still far from a
              market-proof solution. Here we show one-year stable perovskite
              devices by engineering an ultra-stable 2D/3D
              (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite junction. The 2D/3D
              forms an exceptional gradually-organized multi-dimensional
              interface that yields up to 12.9\% efficiency in a carbon-based
              architecture, and 14.6\% in standard mesoporous solar cells. To
              demonstrate the up-scale potential of our technology, we fabricate
              10 × 10 cm2 solar modules by a fully printable industrial-scale
              process, delivering 11.2\% efficiency stable for >10,000 h with
              zero loss in performances measured under controlled standard
              conditions. This innovative stable and low-cost architecture will
              enable the timely commercialization of perovskite solar cells.",

               trihalide perovskites, with a bandgaps of ∼1.55 eV and greater.
               Here, we explore the effect of replacing the methylammonium

               electron and hole diffusion lengths in this material, making it

              attracted attention as light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic
              solar cells. So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in
              a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using a mixture of
              PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent. However, the uncontrolled
              precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological
              variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance
              in the resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for
              practical applications. Here we describe a sequential deposition
              method for the formation of the perovskite pigment within the
              porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first introduced from solution
              into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently
              transformed into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of
              CH3NH3I. We find that the conversion occurs within the nanoporous
              host as soon as the two components come into contact, permitting
              much better control over the perovskite morphology than is
              possible with the previously employed route. Using this technique
              for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly

              zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature). This

              attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has
              yet to be achieved. Organometal halide perovskites have recently
              emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured
              devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to
              achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar
              heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited
              perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical
              power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured
              under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite
              absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified
              device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.",

               first time. CsPbI3 normally resides in a yellow non-perovskite
               phase at room temperature, but by careful processing control and
               development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have
               stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room
               temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a
               variety of architectures, with current–voltage curve measured
               efficiency up to 2.9\% for a planar heterojunction architecture,
               and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7\%. The
               well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range

               simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with

               thought to be a candidate for inducing hysteresis via

               be a ferroelectric material, and thus we can conclude that

               (InI, SbSI, SbSeI, and BiOI) for which time-resolved

               Activation energies are calculated for each of the four

               e-(U) → H2O (5). In the calculational model H+ is a hydronium ion
               with two water molecules hydrogen bonded to it. The electrode
               potential is given by U/V = φ/eV − φH+/H2/eV (6) where φ and

               surface and of the standard hydrogen electrode surface,

               ionization potential, IP, of the electrode and there is an

               semiconductors due to the presence of mobile ions in the

               important questions such as the exact impact of the mobile ions
               on the steady-state power conversion efficiency (PCE) and
               stability remain. Herein, a simple method is proposed to estimate
               the efficiency loss due to mobile ions via ?fast-hysteresis?
               measurements by preventing the perturbation of mobile ions out of
               their equilibrium position at fast scan speeds ( ≈ 1000?V?s?1).
               The ?ion-free? PCE is between 1\% and 3\% higher than the
               steady-state PCE, demonstrating the importance of ion-induced
               losses, even in cells with low levels of hysteresis at typical
               scan speeds ( ≈ 100?mV?s?1). The hysteresis over many orders of
               magnitude in scan speed provides important information on the
               effective ion diffusion constant from the peak hysteresis
               position. The fast-hysteresis measurements are corroborated by
               transient charge extraction and capacitance measurements and
               numerical simulations, which confirm the experimental findings
               and provide important insights into the charge carrier dynamics.
               The proposed method to quantify PCE losses due to field screening

               solar cells (PSCs) generally exhibit undesired large open-circuit

              perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), irrespective of their
              material type (polycrystals or nanocrystals), have not realized
              high luminance, high efficiency and long lifetime simultaneously,
              as they are influenced by intrinsic limitations related to the
              trade-off of properties between charge transport and confinement
              in each type of perovskite material5-8. Here, we report an
              ultra-bright, efficient and stable PeLED made of core/shell
              perovskite nanocrystals with a size of approximately 10 nm,
              obtained using a simple in situ reaction of benzylphosphonic acid
              (BPA) additive with three-dimensional (3D) polycrystalline
              perovskite films, without separate synthesis processes. During the
              reaction, large 3D crystals are split into nanocrystals and the
              BPA surrounds the nanocrystals, achieving strong carrier
              confinement. The BPA shell passivates the undercoordinated lead
              atoms by forming covalent bonds, and thereby greatly reduces the
              trap density while maintaining good charge-transport properties
              for the 3D perovskites. We demonstrate simultaneously efficient,
              bright and stable PeLEDs that have a maximum brightness of
              approximately 470,000 cd m-2, maximum external quantum efficiency

              (PM) can result from redox-active chemicals, including iron and

              This work investigates (•)OH production from iron, copper, and
              quinones, both individually and in mixtures at atmospherically

              1,4-naphthoquinone) produce (•)OH. Mixtures of copper or quinones
              with iron synergistically produce (•)OH at a rate 20-130\% higher
              than the sum of the rates of the individual redox-active species.
              We developed a regression equation from 20 mixtures to predict the

              contribute if present at very high concentrations. This work shows
              that Cu contributes significantly to (•)OH production in ambient

              of HOOH production and dithiothreitol (DTT) loss in ambient PM

               technologies is crucial to lowering the barriers to
               commercialization. In this context, to improve the
               manufacturability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we have
               developed a one-step solution-coating procedure in which the
               hole-selective contact and perovskite light absorber
               spontaneously form, resulting in efficient inverted PSCs. We
               observed that phosphonic or carboxylic acids, incorporated into
               perovskite precursor solutions, self-assemble on the indium tin
               oxide substrate during perovskite film processing. They form a
               robust self-assembled monolayer as an excellent hole-selective
               contact while the perovskite crystallizes. Our approach solves
               wettability issues and simplifies device fabrication, advancing
               the manufacturability of PSCs. Our PSC devices with
               positive–intrinsic–negative (p-i-n) geometry show a power
               conversion efficiency of 24.5\% and retain >90\% of their initial
               efficiency after 1,200 h of operating at the maximum power point
               under continuous illumination. The approach shows good generality
               as it is compatible with different self-assembled monolayer
               molecular systems, perovskites, solvents and processing methods.
               Improving the manufacturability of perovskite solar cells is key

              and M is Sn (1 and 2) or Pb (3 and 4) are reported. The compounds

              the nature of the resulting materials is discussed in terms of

              find that the chemical and physical properties of these materials
              strongly depend on the preparation method. Single crystal X-ray
              diffraction analysis of 1-4 classifies the compounds in the
              perovskite structural family. Structural phase transitions were
              observed and investigated by temperature-dependent single crystal
              X-ray diffraction in the 100-400 K range. The charge transport
              properties of the materials are discussed in conjunction with
              diffuse reflectance studies in the mid-IR region that display
              characteristic absorption features. Temperature-dependent studies
              show a strong dependence of the resistivity as a function of the
              crystal structure. Optical absorption measurements indicate that
              1-4 behave as direct-gap semiconductors with energy band gaps
              distributed in the range of 1.25-1.75 eV. The compounds exhibit an
              intense near-IR photoluminescence (PL) emission in the 700-1000 nm
              range (1.1-1.7 eV) at room temperature. We show that solid
              solutions between the Sn and Pb compounds are readily accessible
              throughout the composition range. The optical properties such as
              energy band gap, emission intensity, and wavelength can be readily
              controlled as we show for the isostructural series of solid
              solutions CH3NH3Sn(1-x)Pb(x)I3 (5). The charge transport type in
              these materials was characterized by Seebeck coefficient and
              Hall-effect measurements. The compounds behave as p- or n-type
              semiconductors depending on the preparation method. The samples
              with the lowest carrier concentration are prepared from solution
              and are n-type; p-type samples can be obtained through solid state
              reactions exposed in air in a controllable manner. In the case of
              Sn compounds, there is a facile tendency toward oxidation which
              causes the materials to be doped with Sn(4+) and thus behave as

               increased anodic peak current associated with a decrease in the

               Accordingly, a mechanism involving generation of Ni3+ active

               Moreover, the corresponding rate law under the control of charge

               all-perovskite tandem solar cells increasing at rapid pace, wide
               bandgap (>1.7 eV) metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) are becoming a
               major focus of academic and industrial photovoltaic research.
               Compared to their lower bandgap (≤1.6 eV) counterparts, these
               types of perovskites suffer from higher levels of non-radiative
               losses in both the bulk material and in device configurations,
               constraining their efficiencies far below their thermodynamic
               potential. In this work, we investigate the energy losses in
               methylammonium (MA) free high-Br-content wide bandgap perovskites
               by using a combination of THz spectroscopy, steady-state and
               time-resolved photoluminescence, coupled with drift-diffusion
               simulations. The investigation of this system allows us to study
               charge-carrier recombination in these materials and devices in
               the absence of halide segregation due to the photostabilty of
               formamidinium-cesium based lead halide perovskites. We find that
               these perovskites are characterised by large non-radiative
               recombination losses in the bulk material and that the interfaces
               with transport layers in solar cell devices strongly limit their
               open-circuit voltage. In particular, we discover that the
               interface with the hole transport layer performs particularly
               poorly, in contrast to 1.6 eV bandgap MHPs which are generally
               limited by the interface with the electron-transport layer. To
               overcome these losses, we incorporate and investigate the
               recombination mechanisms present with perovskites treated with
               the ionic additive 1-butyl-1-methylpipiderinium
               tetrafluoroborate. We find that this additive not only improves
               the radiative efficiency of the bulk perovskite, but also reduces
               the non-radiative recombination at both the hole and electron
               transport layer interfaces of full photovoltaic devices. In
               addition to unravelling the beneficial effect of this specific
               treatment, we further optimise our solar cells by introducing an
               additional LiF interface treatment at the electron transport
               layer interface. Together these treatments enable MA-free 1.79 eV
               bandgap perovskite solar cells with open-circuit voltages of 1.22
               V and power conversion efficiencies approaching 17\%, which is

              solution-processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that not
              only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also changes
              grain growth of Sn-Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion
              length to 3.63 µm. The formation of small perovskite grains at the
              HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost
              constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 96 ± 2\% across the
              absorption spectrum of Sn-Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM
              significantly enhances the stability of Sn-Pb PSCs with 87\% of
              its initial efficiency retained after 1-sun illumination for 1200
              h, and keeps 85\% efficiency under 85 °C thermal stress for 1500
              h. The hybrid HTM further improves the stabilized efficiencies of
              single-junction Sn-Pb PSCs and all-perovskite tandem solar cells
              to 23.2\% and 25.9\%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue
              to the multicomponent metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.",

               “solvent engineering”, single crystals, and state-of-the-art
               solar cells. In contrast to water vapor, the presence of liquid
               water results in the irreversible decomposition of MAPI to form
               PbI2. MAPI changes from dark brown to transparent on hydration;
               the precise optical constants of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O formed on single
               crystals were determined, with a bandgap at 3.1 eV. Using the
               single-crystal optical constants and thin-film ellipsometry
               measurements, the time-dependent changes to MAPI films exposed to

               phase forms independent of the depth in the film, suggesting
               rapid transport of water molecules along grain boundaries.
               Vapor-phase hydration of an unencapsulated solar cell (initially

               a 90\% drop in short-circuit photocurrent and ∼200 mV loss in
               open-circuit potential; however, these losses were fully reversed
               after the device was exposed to dry nitrogen for 6 h. Hysteresis
               in the current–voltage characteristics was significantly
               increased after this dehydration, which may be related to changes
               in the defect density and morphology of MAPI following
               recrystallization from the hydrate. Based on our observations, we
               suggest that irreversible decomposition of MAPI in the presence

  abstract  = "The tin sulfide solar cell has acquired prominence in recent
               years. We present the characteristics of two polymorphs of SnS
               and their perspectives in thin‐film solar cells. Thin‐film SnS
               with cubic crystalline structure (SnS‐CUB) was obtained via two
               chemical routes. This semiconductor is distinct from the more
               common SnS thin films of orthorhombic crystalline structure
               (SnS‐ORT), also obtained by chemical routes. The SnS‐CUB reported
               here with a lattice constant a of 11.587 Å replaces the zinc
               blende structure previously reported for this material with a of
               5.783 Å. Thin films of SnS‐CUB have an optical bandgap (Eg) of
               1.66–1.72 eV and electrical conductivity (σ) of 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1.
               These characteristics distinguish them from SnS‐ORT presented
               here with an Eg of 1.1 eV and σ typically higher by two orders of
               magnitude. We discuss the uncertainties that have prevailed in
               the assignment of crystalline structure for SnS‐CUB and SnS‐ORT.
               The optical and electrical properties of these two polymorphs of
               SnS are contrasted in the context of light‐generated current
               density in solar cells. We conclude that the two SnS polymorphs
               when considered together as optical absorbers offer wider
               prospects for tin sulfide thin‐film solar cells.",

              years due to their low cost and superior technical performance.
              However, the use of toxic metals, such as lead, in the perovskite
              dye and toxic chemicals in perovskite solar cell manufacturing
              causes grave concerns for its environmental performance. To
              understand and facilitate the sustainable development of
              perovskite solar cell technology from its design to manufacturing,
              a comprehensive environmental impact assessment has been conducted
              on titanium dioxide nanotube based perovskite solar cells by using
              an attributional life cycle assessment approach, from cradle to
              gate, with manufacturing data from our laboratory-scale
              experiments and upstream data collected from professional
              databases and the literature. The results indicate that the
              perovskite dye is the primary source of environmental impact,
              associated with 64.77\% total embodied energy and 31.38\% embodied
              materials consumption, contributing to more than 50\% of the life
              cycle impact in almost all impact categories, although lead used
              in the perovskite dye only contributes to about 1.14\% of the
              human toxicity potential. A comparison of perovskite solar cells

              dopants were shown to induce nonradiative recombination of charge
              carriers and foster degradation of the solar cell. Here, in a
              novel approach, highly conductive and inexpensive water-free
              poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is used to replace these

              achieve higher lateral conductivities than layers of doped
              spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, combined transient and steady-state

               we develop ammonium-cation-passivated Pb-Sn perovskites with long

               thickness of approximately 1.2 μm. Molecular dynamics simulations

               (CF3-PA), which exhibits a stronger perovskite surface-passivator

               over 22\%. We report a certified efficiency of 26.4\% in
               all-perovskite tandem solar cells, which exceeds that of the

              that not only the composition but also the precise stoichiometry
              is important for the device performance. Recent reports have, for
              example, demonstrated small amount of PbI2 in the perovskite films
              to be beneficial for the overall performance of both the standard
              perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3, as well as for the mixed perovskites
              (CH3NH3)x(CH(NH2)2)(1-x)PbBryI(3-y). In this work a broad range of
              characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD),
              scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
              microscopy (TEM), photo electron spectroscopy (PES), transient
              absorption spectroscopy (TAS), UV-vis, electroluminescence (EL),
              photoluminescence (PL), and confocal PL mapping have been used to
              further understand the importance of remnant PbI2 in perovskite
              solar cells. Our best devices were over 18\% efficient, and had in
              line with previous results a small amount of excess PbI2. For the
              PbI2-deficient samples, the photocurrent dropped, which could be
              attributed to accumulation of organic species at the grain
              boundaries, low charge carrier mobility, and decreased electron
              injection into the TiO2. The PbI2-deficient compositions did,
              however, also have advantages. The record Voc was as high as 1.20
              V and was found in PbI2-deficient samples. This was correlated
              with high crystal quality, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and
              high PL yields and was rationalized as a consequence of the
              dynamics of the perovskite formation. We further found the ion
              migration to be obstructed in the PbI2-deficient samples, which
              decreased the JV hysteresis and increased the photostability.
              PbI2-deficient synthesis conditions can thus be used to deposit
              perovskites with excellent crystal quality but with the downside
              of grain boundaries enriched in organic species, which act as a
              barrier toward current transport. Exploring ways to tune the
              synthesis conditions to give the high crystal quality obtained
              under PbI2-poor condition while maintaining the favorable grain
              boundary characteristics obtained under PbI2-rich conditions would
              thus be a strategy toward more efficiency devices.",

               nanosecond (ns) pulsed ultraviolet laser to reduce surface
               defects, such as dangling bonds, undesirable phases, and
               suboptimal stoichiometry. A careful control of laser energy and
               scanning speed improves the photophysical properties of the
               surface without compromising the thickness. Using laser
               polishing, a Voc of 1.21 V is achieved for planar PSCs with a
               triple cation composition, showing an improved perovskite/hole
               transport interface by mitigating surface recombination losses.
               We measure an efficiency boost from 18.0\% to 19.3\% with
               improved stability of up to 1000 h. The results open the door to
               a new class of surface modification using lasers for interface
               passivation in well-controllable, automated, scalable, and
               solvent-free surface treatments.",

               perovskite pin devices at open-circuit voltage (VOC) and
               short-circuit current (JSC) conditions. A mismatch between the
               internal quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and the external VOC
               is detrimental for these devices. We demonstrate that modifying
               the perovskite top-surface with guanidinium-Br and imidazolium-Br
               forms a low-dimensional perovskite phase at the n-interface,
               suppressing the QFLS-VOC mismatch, and boosting the VOC.
               Concurrently, the use of an ionic interlayer or a self-assembled
               monolayer at the p-interface reduces the inferred field screening
               induced by mobile ions at JSC, promoting charge extraction and
               raising the JSC. The combination of the n- and p-type
               optimizations allows us to approach the thermodynamic potential

               chalcogenide perovskites. Major experimentally studied compounds

              conversion efficiency (PCE) of photovoltaic (PV) cells beyond the

              challenging to produce by solution-based methods, where
              dissolution of underlying layers is problematic. By employing a
              highly volatile acetonitrile(CH3CN)/methylamine(CH3NH2) (ACN/MA)
              solvent-based perovskite solution, we demonstrate fully

              for monolithic all-perovskite tandem and triple-junction solar
              cells. By combining FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(Br0.7I0.3)3 (1.94 eV) and
              MAPbI3 (1.57 eV) junctions, we reach two-terminal tandem PCEs of
              more than 15\% (steady state). We show that a MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3
              (1.34 eV) narrow band-gap perovskite can be processed via the
              ACN/MA solvent-based system, demonstrating the first

               considerable interest in photovoltaics research because of their
               potential for improved stability compared to their
               organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, the inorganic
               perovskites studied thus far still suffer from lower power
               conversion efficiency and long-term instability due to an
               unfavorable bandgap and either phase instability or air
               sensitivity. Herein, a strategy to mitigate these concerns is
               investigated by alloying tin and lead on the B site to form
               tin–lead-alloyed low-bandgap (∼1.34 eV) inorganic CsSn0.3Pb0.7I3
               perovskites. Solar cells made using this material in a full
               device architecture with PEDOT/PSS hole transport materials (HTM)
               attain power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 9.4\% (stabilized
               PCE 7.2\%). Furthermore, a simple HTM-free device without the
               PEDOT/PSS layer is demonstrated to be more stable than the
               full-structured device and exhibits a PCE of 7.6\% (stabilized
               PCE 7.3\%), the highest efficiency to date for an inorganic
               perovskite with a bandgap below 1.4 eV. This simplified device
               structure shows good reproducibility and stability. This work
               provides a possible route for fabricating low-cost,

              presents a low-cost, vacuum-free fabrication method for this novel
              TE; the approach combines lithography, electroplating, and imprint
              transfer (LEIT) processing. The embedded nature of the EMTEs
              offers many advantages, such as high surface smoothness, which is
              essential for organic electronic device production; superior
              mechanical stability during bending; favorable resistance to
              chemicals and moisture; and strong adhesion with plastic film.
              LEIT fabrication features an electroplating process for
              vacuum-free metal deposition and is favorable for industrial mass
              production. Furthermore, LEIT allows for the fabrication of metal
              mesh with a high aspect ratio (i.e., thickness to linewidth),
              significantly enhancing its electrical conductance without
              adversely losing optical transmittance. We demonstrate several
              prototypes of flexible EMTEs, with sheet resistances lower than 1
              Ω/sq and transmittances greater than 90\%, resulting in very high

               devices with the highest efficiency are prepared by deposition of
               the perovskite layer using non-scalable techniques, toxic
               solvents and/or require additional processing steps. In this
               work, we show that perovskite solar cells can be obtained
               efficiently in one step by doctor blade. The perovskite film is
               formed under a supersaturation regime from non-toxic solvents
               following spherulitic growth. This method results in highly
               crystalline perovskite films with preferential crystal
               orientation. Co-local photoluminescence and light-beam induced
               current experiments show that the generated chemical defects are

               spherulite formation, rather than being detrimental, could lead
               to better photovoltaic performance in hybrid perovskite films.
               This is further confirmed in the photovoltaic devices, which were
               fabricated using non-toxic solvents by doctor blade process, with
               record efficiencies of 18.0\% for MAPbI3 (MA = methyl ammonium).

              precursors as well as the difficulties for upscaling the process
              have restricted their practical development. To deal with these
              shortcomings, in this work, lead sulphide as the lead metal
              precursor was produced by aqueous chemical bath deposition.
              Subsequently, PbS films were chemically converted to PbI2 and
              finally to mixed-cation mixed halide perovskite films. The
              microstructural, optical and solar cell performance of mixed

               The composite photocatalysts exhibited higher activities than
               that of individual Ag3PO4 and In(OH)3, and the highest activity
               (the rate constant kapp = 1.75 min–1) was observed over the
               Ag3PO4/In(OH)3 with a molar ratio of 1.65:1.00. The further
               mechanism study and material characterizations indicated that the
               photocatalytic activity is closely related to the

               development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have
               stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room
               temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a
               variety of architectures, with current–voltage curve measured
               efficiency up to 2.9\% for a planar heterojunction architecture,
               and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7\%. The
               well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range

               simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with

              efficiency as high as 61.2\% at 500 nm, which is among the most
              effective visible-light photocatalysts. XRD patterns and SEM
              images indicate that the NiTi-LDH nanosheets (diameter: 100-200
              nm) are highly dispersed on the surface of RGO. UV-vis absorption
              spectroscopy exhibits that the introduction of RGO enhances the

              verified by the largely decreased band gap (∼1.78 eV) studied by

               than 22\%, the large-area fabrication of PSCs became another
               issue receiving growing attention. For large-area PSCs, more
               reproducibility is required to precisely control the
               crystallization behavior of perovskites. A two-step process has
               been preferred to apply large-area coatings of perovskite because
               of its better reproducibility, but the process has suffered from
               slow and incomplete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. In this
               paper, we propose a fast, simple, two-step method—mediator
               extraction treatment (MET)—for the preparation of a high-quality
               perovskite film. In MET, a pre-deposited PbI2–DMSO complex film
               is converted into a peculiar PbI2 film with a porous morphology
               and unusual crystallographic orientation via the removal of DMSO.
               PbI2 could be completely converted into MAPbI3 by a fast reaction
               with MAI molecules. We demonstrate that this MET process in
               MAPbI3-based PSCs can achieve 18.8\% of the maximum power
               conversion efficiency (PCE) using spin-coating, and 18.3\% of the

              the intrinsic activities of active sites increase, which accounts

               substrates by thermal evaporation and subjected to heat treatment
               at 400 °C for 2 h to achieve crystallinity and stoichiometry. The
               surface comprises spherical grains or elongated flakes depending
               on thickness of films. These films are introduced in to a
               hydrothermal reactor in a medium of zinc acetate and HMTA to
               realize the nanostructures. The process results in the formation
               of ZnO nanowires with dimensions that are strongly dependent on
               the surface microstructure of the ZnO films. The role of
               temperature (90–180 °C) and duration (10 min to 10 h) of
               hydrothermal processing is investigated in detail. It is
               demonstrated that low temperature and short duration are ideal
               for producing nanowires with diameter < 100 nm, while longer
               durations and higher temperatures lead to large diameter and long
               length nanowires. Interestingly, all wires converge to a
               hexagonal shape with increase in duration or temperature. The
               lowest diameter of the vertically aligned nanowires is 50 nm and
               length upto 10 μm is achieved. Optical band gap of the
               homo-structures is of the order of 3.4–3.5 eV. Raman and
               photoluminescence spectra indicate the presence of defects in the
               films. The thin films exhibit a strong defect related
               photoluminescence peak centred around 550 nm. The nanowires grown
               on the films display both the UV-near band edge peak as well as
               the defect related peak. However, the intensity of the defect
               peak decreases with increase in length of the nanowires
               indicating that the photoluminescence of the homo-structures can
               be tuned by changing the surface microstructure of the films and
               also the aspect ratio of the nanowires.",

               functional, passivating, and encapsulating layers on top of
               halide perovskites. Studies in that area have only focused on
               metal oxides, despite a great number of materials that can be
               made with ALD. This work demonstrates that, in addition to
               oxides, other ALD processes can be compatible with the
               perovskites. We describe two new ALD processes for lead sulfide.
               These processes operate at low deposition temperatures (45–155
               °C) that have been inaccessible to previous ALD PbS processes.
               Our processes rely on volatile and reactive lead precursors
               Pb(dbda) (dbda = rac-N2,N3-di-tert-butylbutane-2,3-diamide) and
               Pb(btsa)2 (btsa = bis(trimethylsilyl)amide) as well as H2S. These
               precursors produce high quality PbS thin films that are uniform,
               crystalline, and pure. The films exhibit p-type conductivity and
               good mobilities of 10–70 cm2 V–1 s–1. Low deposition temperatures
               enable direct ALD of PbS onto a halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3
               (MAPI) without its decomposition. The stability of MAPI in
               ambient air is greatly improved by capping with ALD PbS. More
               generally, these new processes offer valuable alternatives for
               PbS-based devices, and we hope that this study will inspire more
               studies on ALD of non-oxides on halide perovskites.",

               popularity as an alternative ?green solvent? to conventional
               organic solvents. The traditional extraction of flavor or
               fragrance from plant materials such as vanillin is a tedious
               procedure that involves the use of organic solvents. In this case
               the solubility of vanillin and its extractability from vanilla
               pods in 14 NADES was evaluated. The solubility in some NADES such
               as lactic acid: propanediol (620 mg/mL) and lactic acid: fructose
               (320 mg/mL) was found to be almost similar to that of organic
               solvents e.g. methanol (632.94 mg/mL) or ethanol (375.81 mg/mL).
               Interestingly, the extractability of vanillin from vanilla pods
               did not reflect the results observed for the solubility tests.
               Some NADES with constituents that are suitable as food
               ingredients such as citric acid-fructose-glucose (CAFG),
               fructose-glucose (FG), malic acid-glucose (MAG), and malic
               acid-fructose-glucose (MAFG), showed a higher extraction power
               (7.6, 10.1, 16.7, and 16.3 mg/g DW, respectively) than ethanol
               (4.4 mg/g DW). The discrepancy between solubility and
               extractability might be due to differences in the interaction
               with the matrix depending on the NADES. The effect of water
               content in some NADES on the extractability of vanillin was also
               studied. With the high extraction capacity and the absence of
               toxicity of their components, NADES are very suitable for
               extraction of flavours and fragrances used in food and cosmetics.",

               desired but mostly lacking. To reveal how C–O bond coupling
               reductive elimination (RE) is stimulated by excited NiII [Welin,
               E. R.; Le, C.; Arias-Rotondo, D. M.; McCusker, J. K.; MacMillan,
               D. W. C. Science 2017, 355, 380], we report here high-level
               theoretical modellings based on a combined ab initio protocol
               (CASSCF, CASPT2, DLPNO–CCSD(T)). In contrast to the experimental
               proposal of the d-d excited state, we find that the
               metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state is most
               likely to stimulate the C–O coupling RE. This unprecedented
               assignment of the reactive excited state not only obviates the
               known thermodynamic prohibition of C–O coupling by ground state
               NiII, but also matches the experimental triplet energy requisite
               for energy transfer. In addition, the enhanced RE reactivity in
               excited NiII can be well rationalized by the NiIII character of
               the MLCT state. The resolution of this intriguing mechanistic
               puzzle in the excited-state chemistry of a NiII complex

               way of fabricating mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanocomposite
               materials composed of metal oxide and spinel phases. A detailed
               understanding of the mechanism of the transformation of the LDH
               precursor to the MMO should allow the properties of the resulting
               MMO nanocomposites to be tailored to specific applications. Here
               we report a systematic investigation of the structure,
               composition, and morphology evolution from ZnAl-LDHs to ZnO-based
               MMO nanocomposites composed of ZnO and ZnAl2O4 on calcination at
               different temperatures. The nucleation and oriented growth of ZnO
               crystallites and the formation of ZnAl2O4 were monitored by high
               resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combined with
               selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), in situ X-ray
               diffraction (XRD), solid-state 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear
               magnetic resonance (27Al MAS NMR), and thermogravimetric and
               differential thermal analyses (TG−DTA). The layered structure of
               the LDH precursor was maintained as the temperature was increased
               from room temperature to 180 °C. Upon further heating from 200 to
               400 °C, ZnO nuclei doped with Al3+ were first formed as an
               amorphous phase and then underwent oriented growth along the
               ⟨101̅0⟩ direction. The high aspect ratio of the LDH platelets is
               responsible for the oriented growth of the resulting ZnO
               crystallites. On further increasing the calcination temperature,
               Zn2+ ions were continuously released from the amorphous phase
               resulting in the formation of crystalline ZnO nanoparticles doped
               with Al3+, which are homogeneously dispersed throughout the
               amorphous phase. When the calcination temperature reached 500 °C,
               Al3+ ions were released from the ZnO-like structure resulting in
               the formation of ZnAl2O4 spinel and the crystallinity of the
               spinel increased gradually with increasing temperature. Sintering
               of ZnO and ZnAl2O4, with concomitant loss of the platelet-like
               morphology, occurred below 800 °C. UV−visible spectroscopy showed
               that the ZnO/ZnAl2O4 nanocomposite prepared by calcination of the
               ZnAl-LDH precursor at 800 °C has superior UV-blocking properties

               23\%. Therefore, the development of efficient bifacial cells is
               expected, but the top transparent electrode is a crucial obstacle
               that must be overcome. In this work, ultrathin silver (Ag) film
               was selected as the top transparent electrode and, particularly,
               a tellurium oxide (TeO2) optical coupling layer was adopted to
               enhance the transmittance of the Ag film in the visible light
               region, which markedly increased the light absorption of devices.
               Compared with PSCs with a pure Ag electrode, the device with a
               TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) top electrode showed significantly
               enhanced bifacial short-circuit current-density and bifacial PCEs
               of 18.86\% (illuminated from the ITO electrode) and 15.12\%
               (illuminated from the Ag electrode). Consequently, in addition to
               its role as a transmittance enhancement layer, TeO2 acted as a
               back reflector when the device was illuminated from the ITO side.
               Furthermore, a previously proposed phenylethylammonium iodide
               treatment method was adopted to improve charge transport at the
               perovskite/fullerene interface. Remarkably, the device achieved
               champion bifacial PCEs of 20.96\% (ITO side) and 17.36\% (Ag
               side), a bifaciality factor of 82.82\%, and a steady PCE output
               and good reproducibility. The large-area device (1 cm2) achieved
               bifacial PCEs of 12.42\% (ITO side) and 10.55\% (Ag side), with
               better performance predicted by simulations. Therefore, the
               TeO2/Ag films are promising transparent electrodes for
               fabricating cost-effective bifacial PSCs.",

               many approaches taken to the deposition of this material,
               one-step spin-coating remains the simplest and most widely used
               method in research laboratories. Although spin-coating is not
               recognised as the ideal manufacturing methodology, it represents
               a starting point from which more scalable deposition methods,
               such as slot-dye coating or ink-jet printing can be developed.
               Here, we introduce a new, low-boiling point, low viscosity
               solvent system that enables rapid, room temperature
               crystallisation of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite
               films, without the use of strongly coordinating aprotic solvents.
               Through the use of this solvent, we produce dense, pinhole free
               films with uniform coverage, high specularity, and enhanced
               optoelectronic properties. We fabricate devices and achieve
               stabilised power conversion efficiencies of over 18\% for films
               which have been annealed at 100 °C, and over 17\% for films which
               have been dried under vacuum and have undergone no thermal
               processing. This deposition technique allows uniform coating on
               substrate areas of up to 125 cm2, showing tremendous promise for
               the fabrication of large area, high efficiency, solution

              defects (about 100 times that within the perovskite layer),
              specifically, deep-level defects, which substantially reduce the
              power conversion efficiency of the devices1-3. Recent efforts to
              reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface
              passivation4-6. However, passivating the perovskite surface that
              interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult,
              because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting
              layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film.
              Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a
              coherent interface could be formed between the
              electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the
              formation of an interlayer between a SnO2 electron-transporting

              coupling Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor.

              charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and
              fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent
              interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a
              power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per

               random distribution of oppositely charged monomers along the
               polymer chains that form transient bonds with a range of bond
               strengths. PAs can be dissolved in aqueous salt solutions and
               then recast via immersion precipitation, making them particularly
               useful as surface coatings in biomedical applications. Moreover,
               this immersion precipitation technique allows these PA hydrogels
               to be fabricated into films less than 100 nm. One critical
               challenge to this aqueous processing method is the
               recrystallization of the salt upon water evaporation. Such
               recrystallization can disrupt the hydrogel morphology especially
               in thin films. In this study, a deep eutectic solvent (DES)

               recrystallization and with simple methods such as spin coating
               and dip coating. These methods allow these hydrogels to be used

               efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabrication
               with high reproducibility. On the other hand, thermal annealing
               is a universal post-treatment method for perovskite films
               preparation. Moreover, thermal management highly depends on
               perovskite materials. However, no specialized study has been
               reported on CsFAMA perovskite to date. Herein, we have
               systematically investigated the influence of thermal annealing
               and annealing time on CsFAMA films and their solar cells. We
               demonstrated that heating time of 45 or 60 min at 100 °C is
               desirable. More interestingly, we found that the unannealed
               CsFAMA films exhibit ultrahigh photoluminescence (PL)
               intensities, much stronger than that of annealed films. Note that
               PL intensities gradually weaken as a function of annealing time.
               In particular, the PL intensities of fresh films (after
               antisolvent dripping) are at least 200 times higher than that of
               60 min annealed films. To our knowledge, it is the first time to
               report this PL behavior. We speculate that it is due to quantum
               confinement effect of perovskite crystal nuclei and “cage effect”
               of DMSO intermediates in the fresh films. To this point, the
               unannealed CsFAMA films may have great potential in PL emission

               have been shown to be ideal candidates for highly efficient and

               challenge for formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is to suppress
               the phase transition from the photoactive black phase into yellow
               nonperovskite δ-phase. Several approaches to stabilize the black
               phase have been developed for solution-based perovskites, whereas
               so far, vacuum-deposited FAPbI3 has rarely been reported. This
               study demonstrates the preparation of FAPbI3 by co-evaporation
               and discusses the influence of the subjacent hole transporting
               layer (HTL) on its phase stability. By using FAI excess in the
               evaporation process in combination with phosphonic acids groups
               from the HTL, the black perovskite phase is stabilized at room
               temperature. Further addition of 32?59\% methylammonium iodide
               (MAI) during the co-evaporation process leads to good absorption
               properties and high PSC efficiencies of 20.4\%. In addition,
               excellent stability is achieved for optimized MAI to FAI ratios,
               maintaining 100\% of the initial PSC performance after 1000 h
               under constant operation. This highly stable perovskite
               composition enables the first monolithic fully textured

              small-scale devices, particularly within the fields of
              photovoltaics, micro-optics and lab- and organ-on-chip, where the
              topological arrangement of the surface can influence a system's
              power generation, optical properties or biological function - such
              as, in the latter case, biomimicking surfaces or topological
              control of cellular differentiation. One of the most promising
              approaches in reducing manufacturing costs and complexity is by
              exploitation of the self-assembling properties of colloidal
              particles. Self-assembly techniques can be used to produce
              colloidal crystals onto surfaces, which can act as replicative
              masks, as has previously been demonstrated with colloidal
              lithography, or templates in mold-replication methods with
              resolutions dependent on particle size. Within this context, a
              particular emerging interest is focused on the use of
              self-assembled colloidal crystal surfaces in polymer replication
              methods such as soft lithography, hot and soft embossing and
              nano-imprint lithography, offering low-cost and high-resolution
              alternatives to conventional lithographic techniques. However,
              there are still challenges to overcome for this surface patterning
              approach to reach a manufacturing reliability and process
              robustness comparable to competitive technologies already
              available in the market, as self-assembly processes are not always
              100\% effective in organizing colloids within a structural pattern
              onto the surface. Defects often occur during template fabrication.
              Furthermore, issues often arise mainly at the interface between
              colloidal crystals and other surfaces and substrates. Particularly
              when utilized in high-temperature pattern replication processes,
              poor adhesion of colloidal particles onto the substrate results in
              degradation of the patterning template. These effects can render
              difficulties in creating stable structures with little defect that
              are well controlled such that a large variety of shapes can be
              reproduced reliably. This review presents an overview of available
              self-assembly methods for the creation of colloidal crystals,
              organized by the type of forces governing the self-assembly
              process: fluidic, physical, external fields, and chemical. The
              main focus lies on the use of spherical particles, which are
              favorable due to their high commercial availability and ease of
              synthesis. However, also shape-anisotropic particle self-assembly
              will be introduced, since it has recently been gaining research
              momentum, offering a greater flexibility in terms of patterning.

              Pb halide perovskite (HaP), a crucial factor for their use in
              photovoltaics, light emission, and radiation detection, remains a
              matter of discussion, in part because of the difficulty in
              determining these densities. Here, we present a powerful approach
              to assess the defect densities, based on electric field mapping in
              working HaP-based solar cells. The minority carrier diffusion
              lengths were deduced from the electric field profile, measured by
              electron beam-induced current (EBIC). The EBIC method was used
              earlier to get the first direct evidence for the n-i-p junction
              structure, at the heart of efficient HaP-based PV cells, and later
              by us and others for further HaP studies. This manuscript includes
              EBIC results on illuminated cell cross sections (in operando) at
              several light intensities to compare optoelectronic
              characteristics of different cells made by different groups in
              several laboratories. We then apply a simple, effective
              single-level defect model that allows deriving the densities (Nr)
              of the defect acting as recombination center. We find Nr ≈ 1 ×
              1013 cm-3 for mixed A cation lead bromide-based HaP films and ∼1 ×
              1014 cm-3 for MAPbBr3(Cl). As EBIC photocurrents are similar at
              the grain bulk and boundaries, we suggest that the defects are at
              the interfaces with selective contacts rather than in the HaP
              film. These results are relevant for photovoltaic devices as the
              EBIC responses distinguish clearly between high- and
              low-efficiency devices. The most efficient devices have n-i-p
              structures with a close-to-intrinsic HaP film, and the selective
              contacts then dictate the electric field strength throughout the
              HaP absorber.",

              AMX3, where M is a metal and X is a halide, are leading candidates
              for high efficiency low cost tandem photovoltaics, in part because
              they have band gaps that can be tuned over a wide range by
              compositional substitution. We experimentally identify two
              competing mechanisms through which the A-site cation influences
              the band gap of 3D metal halide perovskites. Using a smaller
              A-site cation can distort the perovskite lattice in two distinct
              ways: by tilting the MX6 octahedra or by simply contracting the
              lattice isotropically. The former effect tends to raise the band
              gap, while the latter tends to decrease it. Lead iodide
              perovskites show an increase in band gap upon partial substitution
              of the larger formamidinium with the smaller cesium, due to
              octahedral tilting. Perovskites based on tin, which is slightly
              smaller than lead, show the opposite trend: they show no
              octahedral tilting upon Cs-substitution but only a contraction of
              the lattice, leading to progressive reduction of the band gap. We
              outline a strategy to systematically tune the band gap and valence
              and conduction band positions of metal halide perovskites through
              control of the cation composition. Using this strategy, we
              demonstrate solar cells that harvest light in the infrared up to
              1040 nm, reaching a stabilized power conversion efficiency of
              17.8\%, showing promise for improvements of the bottom cell of
              all-perovskite tandem solar cells. The mechanisms of cation-based
              band gap tuning we describe are broadly applicable to 3D metal
              halide perovskites and will be useful in further development of
              perovskite semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.",

              Herein, we systematically investigated the pressure dependence of

              viain situangle-dispersive synchrotron x-ray diffraction and

              observed at pressures of about 4 and 13.4 GPa, respectively.
              Furthermore, the metallization occurred at around 11 GPa, where

               achieve blue emission, practical implementation of this strategy
               has been challenging due to poor colour stability and severe

               wide range of emission wavelengths from 490 to 451 nanometres.
               The emission colour is directly tuned by modifying the halide
               composition. Particularly, our blue and deep-blue light-emitting
               diodes based on three-dimensional perovskites show high EQE

               on precisely controlling the flow of methylammonium iodide

               deposition rate of metal halides (PbCl2 or PbI2). This hybrid
               deposition method allows the growth of perovskite films with
               smooth surface, good crystallinity, high surface coverage,
               uniform chemical composition and semi-transparency. We also
               systematically investigated the effects of the evaporation source

               employing a thin perovskite film (<200 nm), the power conversion

              because they avoid the halide separation that red

              However, the distribution of high-order phases in

               have received immense attention due to its superior efficiency
               and better stability comparing to the classic single-cation
               perovskite solar cells such as MAPbI3 or FAPbI3. A triple-cation
               perovskite layer which has been used most recently is
               cesium-containing FAPbI3-based perovskite. One of decent
               approaches to fabricate the layer is spin-coating technique by
               using two-step deposition process in which mixed lead-halide and
               CsI precursor is firstly spin-coated onto a substrate, then
               organic cation solution is deposited on the lead-halide layer. In
               this work, the results show that the performance of the devices
               from this process is lower than expected that could be due to
               difficulty of cesium ion incorporation as a stabilizer for
               FAPbI3-based perovskite. Perovskite seeding growth is introduced
               to solve the problem where the process is slightly modified from
               conventional two-step deposition methods by adding small amount
               of perovskite seed precursor into PbI2 solution. The
               concentration of the perovskite seed in PbI2 solution was varied
               for 0, 7, 14 and 20\% v/v. The highest average efficiency of
               11.9\% was obtained from 7\% v/v seeding concentration.
               Furthermore, the device performance could be improved by using
               proper amount of chlorobenzene (CB) as an anti-solvent. The
               highest efficiency of 18.4\% was achieved by using 30 µl of

              recombination kinetics [Malferrari et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 115
              (2011) 14732-14750]. To clarify the structural basis of the
              conformational relaxations and the involvement of bound water
              molecules, we analyzed light-induced P(+)Q(A)(-)/PQ(A) difference
              FTIR spectra of RC films at two hydration levels (relative
              humidity r=76\% and r=11\%). Dehydration reduced the amplitude of
              bands in the 3700-3550cm(-1) region, attributed to water molecules
              hydrogen bonded to the RC, previously proposed to stabilize the
              charge separation by dielectric screening [Iwata et al.,
              Biochemistry 48 (2009) 1220-1229]. Other features of the FTIR
              difference spectrum were affected by partial depletion of the
              hydration shell (r=11\%), including contributions from modes of P
              (9-keto groups), and from NH or OH stretching modes of amino
              acidic residues, absorbing in the 3550-3150cm(-1) range, a region
              so far not examined in detail for bacterial RCs. To probe in
              parallel the effects of dehydration on the RC conformational
              relaxations, we analyzed by optical absorption spectroscopy the
              kinetics of P(+)Q(A)(-) recombination following the same
              photoexcitation used in FTIR measurements (20s continuous
              illumination). The results suggest a correlation between the
              observed FTIR spectral changes and the conformational
              rearrangements which, in the hydrated system, strongly stabilize
              the P(+)Q(A)(-) charge separated state over the second time scale.",

              studied utilizing cyclic voltammetry (CV) method and the effects
              of structural factors (cations and anions of ILs, and HBDs and

               An extensive global search was conducted to discover leading
               optometric researchers; 480 names were identified. A
               custom-designed bibliographic search tool was developed to
               interrogate the Scopus database (Elsevier) and extract
               publication metrics using the unique Scopus Author Identifier
               number for each optometrist. On 13 January 2021, the full list

              However, scale-up will be challenging due to the requirement of
              very thin transport layers for high efficiencies, which often
              present spatial inhomogeneities from improper wetting and drying
              during solution processing. Here, we show how a thin Al2O3 layer

              cover regions of imperfect hole transport layer deposition and
              form an intermixed composite with the organic transport layer,
              allowing hole conduction and injection to persist through the
              organic hole transporter. This has the dual effect of reducing
              nonradiative recombination at the heterojunction and improving

               regarded as the next step. Specifically, a high-throughput,

               via R2R-compatible processes necessary to accomplish this goal.
               Herein, we demonstrate the pilot-scale, fully R2R manufacturing
               of all the layers except for electrodes in PSCs. Tert-butyl
               alcohol (tBuOH) is introduced as an eco-friendly antisolvent with

               and 19.1\% for gravure-printed flexible PSCs. As an extended
               work, R2R gravure-printing and tBuOH:EA bathing resulted in the

               the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells by any
               antisolvent via manipulation of the antisolvent application rate.
               Through detailed structural, compositional, and microstructural
               characterization of perovskite layers fabricated by 14 different
               antisolvents, we identify two key factors that influence the
               quality of the perovskite layer: the solubility of the organic
               precursors in the antisolvent and its miscibility with the host
               solvent(s) of the perovskite precursor solution, which combine to
               produce rate-dependent behavior during the antisolvent

               conversion efficiency. However, their large-scale application and
               commercialization are limited by the toxicity issue of lead (Pb).
               Among all the lead-free perovskites, tin (Sn)-based perovskites
               have shown potential due to their low toxicity, ideal bandgap
               structure, high carrier mobility, and long hot carrier lifetime.
               Great progress of Sn-based PSCs has been realized in recent
               years, and the certified efficiency has now reached over 14\%.
               Nevertheless, this record still falls far behind the theoretical
               calculations. This is likely due to the uncontrolled nucleation
               states and pronounced Sn (IV) vacancies. With insights into the

              been achieved in the past a few years. However, the presence of
              lead (Pb) in perovskite composition as a toxic element still
              remains a major issue for large-scale deployment. In this work, a
              novel and facile technique is presented to fabricate tin (Sn)-rich
              perovskite film using metal precursors and an alloying technique.
              Herein, the perovskite films are formed as a result of the
              reaction between Sn/Pb binary alloy metal precursors and
              methylammonium iodide (MAI) vapor in a chemical vapor deposition
              process carried out at 185 °C. It is found that in this approach
              the Pb/Sn precursors are first converted to (Pb/Sn)I2 and further
              reaction with MAI vapor leads to the formation of perovskite
              films. By using Pb-Sn eutectic alloy, perovskite films with large
              grain sizes up to 5 µm can be grown directly from liquid phase
              metal. Consequently, using an alloying technique and this unique
              growth mechanism, a less-toxic and efficient perovskite solar cell
              with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.04\% is
              demonstrated, while pure Sn and Pb perovskite solar cells prepared
              in this manner yield PCEs of 4.62\% and 14.21\%, respectively. It
              is found that this alloying technique can open up a new direction
              to further explore different alloy systems (binary or ternary
              alloys) with even lower melting point.",

              device is based on a mesoporous triple-layer scaffold, and the
              perovskite is deposited in the scaffold as a light absorber.
              Various solvents have been employed to prepare the perovskite
              precursors. However, the coordination between lead halides and the
              solvent molecules may lead to the formation of precipitates after
              a period of storage. The precipitates significantly influence the
              stoichiometric compositions of the precursors, and result in
              undesired variations in the device performance. Herein, we
              introduce ethanol (EtOH) into a typical γ-butyrolactone (GBL)
              based perovskite precursor. The addition of EtOH not only weaken
              the coordination between Pb and solvent molecules, but also
              facilitate the crystallization of the perovskite absorber.
              Besides, the EtOH modified precursor shows improved wettability on

              This work makes it possible to stabilize the perovskite precursors

               passivates undercoordinated defect sites. Importantly, defect
               healing by PEO not only results in an improvement of the

               designing cost-effective, commercially viable tandems. We explore
               the cost-performance trade-off for silicon bottom cells in
               perovskite-silicon tandems, and evaluate the potential of using
               low-cost, lower-efficiency silicon bottom cells, on the basis of
               levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), compared to the
               higher-efficiency, higher-cost bottom cells that have been the
               primary focus of most perovskite-silicon tandem research efforts.
               We fabricate a cost-effective four-terminal silicon-perovskite
               tandem using a low-cost multicrystalline bottom cell and
               calculate the device LCOE. We then extend this analysis by
               modeling performance and LCOE of similar tandems instead using
               high-efficiency silicon bottom cells, enabling direct comparison
               of a low-cost and a high-efficiency tandem. Lastly parametric
               analyses are performed to more broadly examine the bottom-cell
               cost-performance trade-off. We show that low-cost silicon, even
               at the detriment of efficiency, is the more likely path to make
               perovskite-silicon tandems commercially viable and enable future
               reductions in LCOE, given both current and near-future silicon
               technology. We lay out a clear economic motivation for pursuing
               low-cost silicon bottom cells in perovskite-silicon tandems,
               showing that they can achieve a 15–20\% relative LCOE reduction
               compared to the single-junction sub-cells. This is a 2–3 times
               greater relative LCOE reduction compared with using
               high-efficiency silicon. Furthermore, we show that the advantage
               of using low-cost silicon bottom cells is robust to and benefits
               from expected market trends, such as falling system costs and
               advanced, low-cost manufacturing. This work provides a clear
               pathway to cost-effective tandems, outlines the benefits for

               engineering is considered as an effective strategy to achieve

               film and highly thermal stability. However, hysteresis, as a

               triple-cation perovskite based PSCs has become a complex issue to
               be solved on the road to the commercialization of PSCs. The

               the one hand, makes the crystal quality of perovskite thin film

               Good crystallization and low defect density of perovskite layer
               are very important to ensure good light absorption and

               solvent for the HTM. With this, state‐of‐the‐art efficiencies
               close to 20.5\%, the highest to date without using toxic CB or
               TLN, are reached. Through scanning electron microscopy, UV–vis,
               photoluminescence, and X‐ray diffraction, it is shown that ANS
               results in similar mixed‐ion perovskite films under glovebox
               atmosphere as CB and TLN. This underlines that ANS is indeed a
               viable green solvent system for PSCs and should urgently be
               adopted by labs and companies to avoid systematic health risks

               and grain structure of the photoactive material is typically
               required to fabricate high-performance photovoltaic (PV) devices.
               Organo-metal halide perovskite materials, however, exhibit a
               large degree of tolerance in synthesis and can be fabricated into
               high efficiency devices by a variety of different vacuum and
               solution-based processes, with a wide range of precursor ratios.
               This suggests that the phase field for the desired material is
               wider than expected or that high device efficiency may be
               achieved with a range of phases. Here, we investigate the
               structural and optical properties of the materials formed when a
               range of compositions of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead
               iodide (PbI2) were reacted at temperatures from 40 to 190 °C. The
               reactions were performed according to a commonly employed
               synthetic approach for high efficiency PV devices, and the data
               was analyzed to construct a pseudobinary, temperature-dependent,
               phase-composition processing diagram. Escape of MAI vapor at the
               highest temperatures (150–190 °C) enabled a PbI2 phase to persist
               to very high MAI concentrations, and the processing diagram was
               not representative of phase equilibrium in this range. Data from
               reactions performed with a fixed vapor pressure of MAI allowed
               the high temperature portion of the diagram to be corrected and a
               near-equilibrium phase diagram to be proposed. The perovskite
               phase field is wider than previously thought under both
               processing conditions and extended by the existence of stacked
               perovskite sheet phases. Several aspects of the diagrams clarify
               why the organo-halide perovskite materials are compatible with
               solution processing.",

               their inherent high density of detrimental Sn(IV) defects.
               Herein, we demonstrate a sequential surface treatment method,
               which entails a Sn(II) halide treatment to displace the buried
               Sn(IV) ions underneath the film surface, followed by a H2O
               treatment to hydrolyze the displaced Sn(IV) ions. The surface
               treatment induces chemical and microstructural reconstructions
               that significantly improve the optoelectronic properties and
               stability of perovskites. As a result, a power conversion
               efficiency of 16.79\% and a T90 stability of 958 h are achieved,
               topping all previously reported performance parameters for
               inorganic Sn–Pb PSCs. This achievement further shortens the
               performance gap between all-inorganic and hybrid
               organic–inorganic Sn–Pb PSCs with sub-1.4 eV bandgaps.",

              inverted polymer solar cell (OPV). We analyse the impacts from

              in the analysis and further present a sensitivity analysis with
              the operational lifetime as a basis. We find that the major impact

              optoelectronic devices and yet their effect in halide perovskite
              materials is still not understood. The biggest factor limiting
              progress is the inability to identify grain boundaries.
              Noncrystallographic techniques can misidentify grain boundaries,
              leading to conflicting literature reports about their influence;
              however, the gold standard - electron backscatter diffraction
              (EBSD) - destroys halide perovskite thin films. Here, this problem
              is solved by using a solid-state EBSD detector with 6000 times
              higher sensitivity than the traditional phosphor screen and
              camera. Correlating true grain size with photoluminescence
              lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and mobility shows that grain
              boundaries are not benign but have a recombination velocity of
              1670 cm s-1 , comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Amorphous
              grain boundaries are also observed that give rise to locally
              brighter photoluminescence intensity and longer lifetimes. This
              anomalous grain boundary character offers a possible explanation
              for the mysteriously long lifetime and record efficiency achieved
              in small grain halide perovskite thin films. It also suggests a
              new approach for passivating grain boundaries, independent of
              surface passivation, to lead to even better performance in
              optoelectronic devices.",

               complex in the form of a lead polyhalide framework between
               organic and inorganic components and can be structurally tuned by

              compositions, the Urbach energy varies from 18 to 65 meV for
              perovskite films with similar bandgap energies. For most of the

              dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar
              cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide
              perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface produces a
              photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around
              3–4\%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2
              years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However,
              the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention
              because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of
              the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and
              high efficiency (∼10\%) perovskite solar cell was developed in
              2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid
              electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18\% in just 2

               higher conductivity, and closer conduction band alignment to
               methylammonium (MA)PbI3, ZnO is largely overlooked due to a
               chemical instability when in contact with metal halide
               perovskites, which leads to rapid decomposition of the
               perovskite. While surface passivation techniques have somewhat
               mitigated this instability, investigations as to whether all
               metal halide perovskites exhibit this instability with ZnO are
               yet to be undertaken. Experimental methods to elucidate the

               substituting MA with formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs), the

               it is found that stability compares favorably with SnO2-based

               layers is designed as a transparent electrode. The large surface

               formamidinium/methylammonium (FA/MA)] and triple-cation (e.g.,
               Cs/FA/MA) FA-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to enhance their
               power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and device stability.
               Although many antisolvents have been applied to treat various
               perovskites with different compositions, their crystallization
               mechanisms have remained unclear. In this study, we investigated
               the effects of a series of green antisolvents—namely, the ethers
               diethyl ether, anisole, diisopropyl ether (DIE), and dibutyl
               ether—on the crystallization of perovskites. We found that the
               formation of an intermediate phase was heavily determined by the
               antisolvent's polarity. Indeed, through judicious control of the
               antisolvent's polarity, it was possible to form a pure
               intermediate phase, without a PbI2 or perovskite phase. Upon
               thermal annealing, the crystallization of perovskites was
               improved. Understanding the mechanism of formation of the
               intermediate phase led us to identify DIE as a green antisolvent
               with universal perovskite compatibility, achieving champion PCEs
               of 20.05\%, 20.15\%, and 21.26\% for Cs/FA, FA/MA, and Cs/FA/MA,
               respectively. The PCE of large-area (1 cm2) PSCs reached 18.51\%.
               Furthermore, the repeatability of these champion PCEs was greatly
               improved. This work contributes to the understanding of
               antisolvent's polarity as an important factor affecting the
               formation of a pure intermediate phase of FA-based perovskites,
               which also offers a greener approach for the production of PSCs.",

              and it is a very promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution
              reaction (OER). However, the processes occurring on the NiOOH
              surface during charge accumulation and OER are not well
              understood. This work presents an in situ Surface Enhanced Raman
              Spectroscopy (SERS) study of the pH dependent interfacial changes
              of the NiOOH catalyst under the working conditions used for OER.
              We demonstrate the important effect of the electrolyte pH on the
              degree of surface deprotonation of NiOOH, which crucially affects
              its OER activity. Our results show that the deprotonation of NiOOH
              produces negatively charged (or proton-deficient) surface species,
              which are responsible for the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH in
              highly alkaline pH. Moreover, we provide spectroscopic evidence
              obtained in an 18O-labeled electrolyte that allows us to assign
              this surface species to a superoxo-type species (Ni-OO-).

              consistent with the observed pH-sensitivity, and that also
              explains why NiOOH is not a suitable catalyst for applications in
              neutral or moderately alkaline pH (in the range 7-11), apart from

               influencing the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar

               cesium (Cs)-substituted perovskite films with complete surface
               coverage. Apart from the simplified procedure, the present method
               also promises tunable band gap, reduced trap-state density and
               longer carrier lifetime, leading to solar cell efficiency as high
               as 20.13\%, which is among the highest reported for planar

              of perovskite thin films can be achieved through a variety of
              techniques, thermal vapor deposition is particularly promising,
              allowing for high-throughput fabrication. However, the ability to
              control the nucleation and growth of these materials, particularly
              at the charge-transport layer/perovskite interface, is critical to
              unlocking the full potential of vapor-deposited perovskite PV. In
              this study, we explore the use of a templating layer to control
              the growth of coevaporated perovskite films and find that such
              templating leads to highly oriented films with identical
              morphology, crystal structure, and optoelectronic properties

              describing the geometric conditions under which a perovskite can
              form, is much more effective than previously thought and allows us
              to predict perovskites with a fidelity of 80\%. By supplementing
              this principle with inferential statistics and internet data
              mining we establish that currently known perovskites are only the
              tip of the iceberg, and we enumerate 90,000 hitherto-unknown

              β(II)/β(III) for the thicker particles and for the thinner

               methanogenic bacteria and in other biological systems has focused
               attention on the redox chemistry of nickel. This chapter
               discusses the redox chemistry of nickel basing on the most recent
               advances. This chapter presents a discussion on the structural
               and electronic requirements of the four oxidation states—I, II,
               III, and IV— and of the primary physical techniques and probes
               used. A description of the most commonly used ligand types
               follows, together with an indication of recent trends in the
               area. Discussions conclude with a review of the recent
               mechanistic chemistry of the oxidation states in turn. The
               nickel(II) ion has a d8 electronic configuration and, with
               weak-field ligands such as H2O, it forms a six-coordinate ion
               with approximately octahedral symmetry and a paramagnetic (two
               unpaired electrons) 3A2 ground state. The X-ray crystal
               structures of a variety of high- and low-oxidation-state nickel
               complexes are now known. The technique most widely applied as a
               structural probe in the chemistry of both nickel(III) and
               nickel(I) is electron paramagnetic resonance. The mechanistic
               chemistry of nickel(IV) is dominated by substitution inert

              strongly absorbing chromophores, which are able to interact, thus

              obtain absorption spectra of aggregated species with a fairly good
              correction of the scattering component. The RLS spectrum, obtained

              Jan D'Haen is full professor at Hasselt University. After
              obtaining his PhD in 1996 on plasma nitriding of pure iron, he
              became responsible for several physical and chemical analytical
              characterization techniques at the Materials Research Institute
              (IMO) of Hasselt University. His specialties are diffraction (XRD,
              EBSD) and scanning and transmission electron microscopy,
              investigating a wide range of material classes, including hybrid
              metal halide perovskites. Hans-Gerd Boyen studied mathematics and
              physics at the University of Karlsruhe where he also obtained a
              PhD in Physics. Subsequently, he worked as post-doc at the
              University of Basel (habilitation in physics) and as senior
              scientist at the University of Ulm focusing on topics in
              nanoscience and nanotechnology. In 2007, he became full professor
              of Experimental Physics at the Institute for Materials Research
              (IMO-IMOMEC) at Hasselt University, heading the Nanostructure
              Physics Group ever since. Research topics include nanomaterials,
              molecular layers, cubic boron nitride, perovskite-based thin film
              photovoltaics, surfaces and interfaces in general, all studied by
              exploiting a variety of electron spectroscopic tools. Bert Conings
              obtained his master’s degree in Applied Physics (Nanoscience and
              Technology) at the Eindhoven University of Technology (NL) in
              2008. He completed his PhD on hybrid solar cells at Hasselt
              University (BE) in 2012. He was then appointed as postdoctoral
              researcher at Hasselt University, where he became a postdoctoral
              fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) in 2013. His core
              focus is perovskite photovoltaics at the device level and the
              material level. More generally, his interests include the
              electro-optical characterization of nanostructured materials for
              applications in energy and life sciences.",

               energies of different species and structural properties such as
               atom–atom radial distribution functions (RDFs), the
               hydrogen-bonding network between species, and spatial
               distribution functions (SDFs) were computed to understand
               effective interactions in the eutectic mixture formation. It was
               found that the insertion of glucose molecules reduced the
               accumulation of chloride anions around choline cations,
               eventually decreasing the interaction between the choline
               chloride ion pairs. Moreover, the possible explanations for the
               thermos-physical properties of DESs, such as the shear viscosity
               and density, have been provided. Dynamical properties of DES were

               the molecules on each other. This growing trend of migration may
               lead to an increase in the self-diffusion coefficient of
               molecules. Structural analysis revealed that a ratio of 1:1 of
               glucose: choline chloride could provide the best condition to
               maintain the low melting point of the mixture due to the strong

               aqueous solutions, or have properties dominated by the eutectic
               pair, is unclear. Here, we unambiguously show the structure of
               choline chloride-malic acid (malicine) as a liquid, and also in
               solid and hydrated forms, using neutron total scattering on D/H
               isotope-substituted samples, and quasi-elastic neutron scattering
               (QENS). Data were refined using empirical potential structure
               refinement. We show evidence for a stoichiometric complex ion
               cluster in the disordered liquid, with strong choline–chloride
               bonding and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) contribution. The 1:1
               eutectic stoichiometry makes these ionic domains more
               well-defined, with less HBD clustering than seen previously for
               reline. There is minimal structural difference for the solidified
               material, demonstrating that this DES solidification is a glass
               transition rather than a first order phase change. QENS data
               support this by showing a gradual change in solvent dynamics
               rather than a step change. The DES structure is mostly retained
               upon hydration, with water acting both as a secondary smaller HBD
               at closer range to choline than malic acid, and forming transient
               wormlike aggregates. This new understanding of DES structure will

               (ChCl) and water with molar ratio 1:3.33, is explored at ambient
               conditions. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation tools, we
               extract structural information at atomistic level on the nature
               of inter-correlations between the different moieties. Despite
               being a very fluid liquid, with much lower viscosity than other
               common ChCl-based DES, aquoline turns out to be very structured.
               Computed X-ray and neutron weighted scattering patterns (the
               latter also on selectively deuterated mixtures) highlight the
               existence of mesoscopic organization that is rationalised in
               terms of choline vs. water/chloride structural alternation. The
               study shows that choline cations are highly coordinating the
               surrounding environment: strong hydrogen bonding mediated
               correlations between the hydroxyl group and water or chloride are
               detected. In addition, the ammonium group drives the formation of

               hydroxyl moieties approaching it, between the hindering methyl
               groups. Strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between water
               molecules and between water and anions are detected and, while

               its network with neighbour water or anions develops long chains

              industries as lubricant additives to reduce friction and to
              enhance fuel economy. Sulfur-containing additives such as zinc
              dithiophosphates (ZnDTP) are proposed to play a key role in the
              improvement of friction reducing properties of MoDTC in formulated
              lubricants by facilitating the formation of MoS2 tribofilm at the
              rubbing contacts. This study focuses on the interactions between
              MoDTC and ZnDTP under conditions comparable with those prevailing
              in operating engines. The capacity of ZnDTP to sulfurize MoDTC in
              solution in a hydrocarbon base oil could be demonstrated.
              Sulfurized Mo complexes bearing one or two additional sulfur atoms
              (1S-MoDTC and 2S-MoDTC, respectively) which have replaced the
              genuine oxygen atom(s) from the MoDTC core were detected and
              quantified using a specifically developed HPLC-MS analytical
              method. A possible sulfurization mechanism relying on the higher
              affinity of phosphorus from ZnDTP for oxygen could be proposed. In
              parallel, the evolution and molecular transformation of the
              prepared 2S-MoDTC in hydrocarbon base oil under thermal and
              thermo-oxidative conditions were followed using HPLC-MS and
              compared with the evolution of their friction coefficients.
              2S-MoDTC complexes were shown to exhibit a better retention of
              friction reducing capability under oxidative conditions than the
              ``classical'' MoDTC, although they did not seem to significantly
              reduce the friction coefficients of lubricants as compared to the
              ``classical'' MoDTC. Therefore, sulfurization of MoDTC by ZnDTP
              might contribute to delaying the progressive consumption of MoDTC
              and the loss of their friction-reducing efficiency in lubricants
              under thermo-oxidative conditions.",

               remain to be addressed by the research community, using hole

  abstract = "The hydroxyl radical (·OH) is a powerful oxidant that is produced
              in a wide range of environments via the Fenton reaction (Fe2+ +
              H2O2 → Fe3+ + ·OH + OH-). The reactants are formed from the
              reduction of Fe3+ and O2, which may be promoted by organic
              reductants, such as hydroquinones. The aim of this study was to
              investigate the extent of ·OH formation in reactions between
              2,6-dimethoxyhydroquinone (2,6-DMHQ) and iron oxide nanoparticles.
              We further compared the reactivities of ferrihydrite and goethite
              and investigated the effects of the O2 concentration and pH on the
              generation of ·OH. The main finding was that the reactions between
              2,6-DMHQ and iron oxide nanoparticles generated substantial
              amounts of ·OH under certain conditions via parallel reductive
              dissolution and catalytic oxidation reactions. The presence of O2
              was essential for the catalytic oxidation of 2,6-DMHQ and the
              generation of H2O2. Moreover, the higher reduction potential of
              ferrihydrite relative to that of goethite made the former species
              more susceptible to reductive dissolution, which favored the
              production of ·OH. The results highlighted the effects of surface
              charge and ligand competition on the 2,6-DMHQ oxidation processes
              and showed that the co-adsorption of anions can promote the

               reveal that in prototypical MASnI3 (MA = CH3NH3), oxygen by
               itself is not a recombination center. Instead, it tends to form
               substitutional OI through combining with native I vacancies (VI)

               halide perovskites with fluorinated 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA)
               spacer cations. It is found that the substitution of up to five F
               atoms in the phenyl ring makes C slightly positively charged due
               to ∼0.5e charge transfer to electronegative F. This leads to the
               formation of electric dipoles in the spacer cation region and
               polarization of the charge density. This improves the formation
               energy and enhances the stability of the layers. The charge
               transfer makes some of the C 2p orbitals partly empty so that
               they hybridize with F 2p orbitals near the conduction band
               minimum. This is interesting for the charge transport
               perpendicular to the layers. Our study further shows that

               chemically tuned RP layers whereas changing the halide ions I
               with Br has an impact on the orientation of the organic
               molecules. The calculated structures of the layers agree well
               with the available experimental results and suggest structures of
               some unexplored layers that would be interesting to fabricate.
               The calculated electronic structure and optical properties show
               that the absorption coefficient is high (∼105 cm–1) for the
               layers having heavily fluorinated spacer cations. Furthermore, we
               find higher stability and a desirable lower direct band gap for

              nickel-borate (NiBi) OEC. Mechanistic studies of anodized films of
              NiBi exhibit the low Tafel slope of 2.3 × RT/2F (30 mV/decade at
              25 °C). This Tafel slope together with an inverse third order rate
              dependence on H(+) activity establishes NiBi as an ideal catalyst
              to be used in the construction of photoelectrochemical devices for
              water splitting. In contrast, nonanodized NiBi films display
              significantly poorer activity relative to their anodized congeners

               of attention as lead-free perovskite materials. However,
               photovoltaic performances of these devices remain poor, mostly
               due to their low-dimensional crystal structure and large bandgap.
               Here, a dynamic hot casting technique to fabricate silver bismuth
               iodide-based perovskite solar cells under an ambient atmosphere
               with power conversion efficiencies above 2.5\% is demonstrated.
               Silver bismuth iodides are 3D analogs of complex ternary bismuth
               halides with a suitable bandgap for a single junction solar cell.
               As far as it is known, these results represent the highest
               efficiency for solution processed air-stable lead-free perovskite
               solar cells. The enhanced solar cell performance via this dynamic

               of attention as lead-free perovskite materials. However,
               photovoltaic performances of these devices remain poor, mostly
               due to their low-dimensional crystal structure and large bandgap.
               Here, a dynamic hot casting technique to fabricate silver bismuth
               iodide-based perovskite solar cells under an ambient atmosphere
               with power conversion efficiencies above 2.5\% is demonstrated.
               Silver bismuth iodides are 3D analogs of complex ternary bismuth
               halides with a suitable bandgap for a single junction solar cell.
               As far as it is known, these results represent the highest
               efficiency for solution processed air-stable lead-free perovskite
               solar cells. The enhanced solar cell performance via this dynamic
               hot casting technique can be attributed to long carrier
               lifetimes, micrometer-sized crystalline grains, and pinhole free
               thin-film formation with uniform morphology. This work provides a
               new direction for fabrication of solution-processed lead-free
               perovskite solar cells with a rapid fabrication strategy

               been already demonstrated, however, so far, only in n-i-p
               configuration. Currently, the overall major challenges are the
               complex evaporation characteristics of organic precursors that
               strongly depend on the underlying charge selective contacts and
               the insufficient reproducibility of the co-evaporation process.
               To ensure a reliable co-evaporation process, it is important to
               identify the impact of different parameters in order to develop a
               more detailed understanding. In this work, we study the influence
               of the substrate temperature, underlying hole-transport layer
               (polymer PTAA versus self-assembling monolayer molecule
               MeO-2PACz), and perovskite precursor ratio on the morphology,
               composition, and performance of co-evaporated p-i-n perovskite
               solar cells. We first analyze the evaporation of pure precursor
               materials and show that the adhesion of methylammonium iodide
               (MAI) is significantly reduced with increased substrate
               temperature, while it remains almost unaffected for lead iodide
               (PbI2). This substrate temperature-dependent evaporation behavior
               of MAI is also transferred to the co-evaporation process and can
               directly influence the perovskite composition. We demonstrate
               that the optimal substrate temperature window for perovskite
               deposition is close to room temperature. At high temperature, not
               enough MAI for precise stoichiometry is incorporated even with
               very high MAI rates. While, at temperatures below −25 °C, the
               conversion of MAI with PbI2 is inhibited, and an amorphous yet
               unreacted film is formed. We observe that perovskite composition
               and morphology vary widely between the organic hole-transport
               layers (HTLs) PTAA and MeO-2PACz. For all substrate temperatures,
               MeO-2PACz enables higher solar cell PCEs than PTAA. Through the
               combination of vapor-deposited perovskites and a self-assembled
               monolayer, we achieve a stabilized power conversion efficiency of
               20.6\%, which is the first reported PCE above 20\% for evaporated
               perovskite solar cells in p-i-n architecture.",

              Photoluminescence quantum yields close to unity have been achieved
              for perovskite nanocrystals across a broad range of emission
              colours, and light-emitting diodes with external quantum
              efficiencies exceeding 20 per cent-approaching those of commercial
              organic light-emitting diodes-have been demonstrated in both the
              infrared and the green emission channels1,3,4. However, owing to
              the formation of lower-bandgap iodide-rich domains, efficient and
              colour-stable red electroluminescence from mixed-halide
              perovskites has not yet been realized5,6. Here we report the
              treatment of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with
              multidentate ligands to suppress halide segregation under
              electroluminescent operation. We demonstrate colour-stable, red
              emission centred at 620 nanometres, with an electroluminescence
              external quantum efficiency of 20.3 per cent. We show that a key
              function of the ligand treatment is to 'clean' the nanocrystal
              surface through the removal of lead atoms. Density functional
              theory calculations reveal that the binding between the ligands
              and the nanocrystal surface suppresses the formation of iodine
              Frenkel defects, which in turn inhibits halide segregation. Our
              work exemplifies how the functionality of metal halide perovskites
              is extremely sensitive to the nature of the (nano)crystalline
              surface and presents a route through which to control the
              formation and migration of surface defects. This is critical to
              achieve bandgap stability for light emission and could also have a
              broader impact on other optoelectronic applications-such as
              photovoltaics-for which bandgap stability is required.",

               However, the traditional mesoporous layer suffers from low

               field of perovskite materials and photovoltaic technologies. One
               of their most extraordinary characteristics is the high quality
               of layers that can be obtained by ?dirty processing? from
               solution at low temperatures. Alternatively, perovskites can also
               be deposited by thermal evaporation, a clean, solvent-free
               process, which is well established for many industrial
               applications. Although the vast majority of research reports
               focus on solution-processing as the deposition method for
               perovskite solar cells, thermally evaporated perovskite solar
               cells are closing in the performance gap with several reports of
               efficiencies above 20\%. In this Progress Report, the two
               deposition methods are briefly introduced, the key developments
               in photovoltaic devices based on each deposition technique are
               outlined, and the challenges and future possibilities are

              superstrate configuration, in which the device is illuminated from
              the substrate side. This limits the fabrication of the solar cell
              to transparent substrates, typically glass coated with a
              transparent conductive oxide (TCO), and adds constraints because
              the first subcell that is deposited on the substrate must contain
              the wide-bandgap perovskite. However, devices in the substrate
              configuration could potentially be fabricated on a large variety
              of opaque and inexpensive substrates, such as plastic and metal
              foils. Importantly, in the substrate configuration the
              narrow-bandgap subcell is deposited first, which allows for more
              freedom in the device design. In this work, we report
              perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells fabricated in the

              vacuum sublimation, starting with the charge recombination layers,
              then the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell, and finishing with the
              transparent top TCO electrode. Proof-of-concept tandem solar cells
              show a maximum PCE of 20\%, which is still moderate compared to
              those of best-in-class devices realized in the superstrate

              the pyrometallurgical process that has dominated lead production
              for millennia. The proposed process involves the dissolution of Pb
              salts into the deep eutectic solvent (DES) Ethaline 200, a liquid
              formed when a 1 : 2 molar ratio of choline chloride and ethylene

              through electrodeposition and the liquid can then be recycled for

               one-third of the drugs listed in the various Pharmacopeias fall
               into the poorly water-soluble or water-insoluble categories. For
               more than 200 years, traditional solvents could be used as a
               solvent for substances that were insoluble in water. But the
               usage of these types of solvents should be decreased because
               these types of solvents are volatile, flammable, and often toxic.
               Also, the industrialist’s usages in different types of processes
               prove the risk for workers. In recent years, several solvents
               have been proposed to be the greener replacement for traditional
               solvents. Replacing hazardous chemicals with more environmentally
               friendly alternatives is a matter of current interest, in line
               with the philosophy of Green Chemistry. The use of nontraditional
               or nonconventional solvents such as supercritical fluids (SCFs)
               such as Carbon dioxide (CO2) and water, fluorous solvents,

               (DESs) are alternatives for environmentally unfriendly
               traditional solvents. Among them, DES is a neoteric class of
               green solvents defined as a mixture of two or more compounds that
               are typically solid at room temperature, but when combined at a
               particular molar ratio, changes into a liquid at room
               temperature. It is assumed that eutectic mixtures show low
               volatility, have a broad liquid range, and are water-compatible,
               non-flammable, non-toxic, biocompatible, and eco-friendly.

              the α-phase is transformed into a β(II)-phase via a dissolution,

              partially lost during the ageing tests. Soft oxidation of the

              yields a β(II)-phase very similar to the starting material but
              exhibiting a mosaıc texture. Strong oxidation of the β(II)-phase

              reduction reactions of the α-phase progressively lead to a
              β(II)-phase via the formation of interstratified materials. A SEM

              partial loss of zinc is evidenced during strong oxidation of
              β(II)- and α-phases. Since a large amount of zinc is lost during

              rechargeable Ni(OH)2-based battery systems such as NiMH and NiCd,

              metals in these layers on the electrochemical performance will be
              highlighted. Using EQCM much information can be obtained, as both
              the electrochemical response and accompanying mass changes can be
              measured simultaneously. EQCM was extensively used to investigate
              the effect of the conditions on the formation of Ni(OH)2 thin
              layers, the α-to-β modification changes and the details of the
              redox mechanism. The proposed redox mechanisms differ in whether
              H+ or OH− is transferred, the reactants and/or products are
              hydrated and cations from the solution take part in the reaction.
              By incorporation of other metals in the structure, the
              characteristics of thin Ni(OH)2 layers can be tuned. This affects
              the oxidation and reduction potential, the reversibility, the
              stability of the structure and the oxygen evolution side reaction.
              Co2+ and Fe2+ were shown to replace Ni-sites in the hydrous oxide
              lattice, thereby forming very dense structures with higher
              stability. However, structural changes still occur in most cases.
              Due to this inhomogeneity, the layers are usually a combination of
              different structures, depending on the distribution of the
              incorporated metal(s). Suppression of the oxygen evolution
              reaction is reported for Co, Pb, Pd, Zn and Mn. The effects of Co
              and Mn are shown to depend on the incorporated amount. Co shifts
              the standard redox potential for the oxygen evolution reaction
              towards more cathodic potentials and decreases the oxygen
              overpotential significantly. Light-weight rare-earth elements also
              catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction.",

              one of two ways: mild anodization or hard anodization. The first
              method produces self-ordered pore structures, but it is slow and
              only works for a narrow range of processing conditions; the second
              method, which is widely used in the aluminium industry, is faster,
              but it produces films with disordered pore structures. Here we
              report a novel approach termed ``pulse anodization'' that combines
              the advantages of the mild and hard anodization processes. By
              designing the pulse sequences it is possible to control both the
              composition and pore structure of the anodic aluminium oxide films
              while maintaining high throughput. We use pulse anodization to
              delaminate a single as-prepared anodic film into a stack of
              well-defined nanoporous alumina membrane sheets, and also to
              fabricate novel three-dimensional nanostructures.",

              particulate matter (PM) to several adverse health effects,
              including cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality.
              Despite these links, the mechanisms by which PM causes adverse
              health effects are poorly understood. The generation of hydroxyl
              radical (.OH) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) through
              transition metal-mediated pathways is one of the main hypotheses
              for PM toxicity. In order to better understand the ability of
              particulate transition metals to produce ROS, we have quantified
              the amounts of .OH produced from dissolved iron and copper in a
              cell-free, surrogate lung fluid (SLF). We also examined how two
              important biological molecules, citrate and ascorbate, affect the
              generation of .OH by these metals. We have found that Fe(II) and
              Fe(III) produce little .OH in the absence of ascorbate and
              citrate, but that they efficiently make .OH in the presence of
              ascorbate and this is further enhanced when citrate is also added.
              In the presence of ascorbate, with or without citrate, the
              oxidation state of iron makes little difference on the amount of
              .OH formed after 24 hours. In the case of Cu(II), the production
              of .OH is greatly enhanced in the presence of ascorbate, but is
              inhibited by the addition of citrate. The mechanism for this
              effect is unclear, but appears to involve formation of a
              citrate-copper complex that is apparently less reactive than free,
              aquated copper in either the generation of HOOH or in the
              Fenton-like reaction of copper with HOOH to make .OH. By
              quantifying the amount of .OH that Fe and Cu can produce in
              surrogate lung fluid, we have provided a first step into being
              able to predict the amounts of .OH that can be produced in the
              human lung from exposure to PM containing known amounts of
              transition metals.",

              response may be characterized separately for four different
              processes, selected by the potential range and by the surface
              pretreatment: hydrogen adsorption/desorption, oxygen
              adsorption/desorption (and/or surface oxidation/reduction), and
              nominally capacitive charging of the Pt surface in two different
              states, clean and oxide-covered. While each process exhibits a
              roughly linear response, the magnitude and even the sign of the
              slope, which determines the surface stress–charge coefficient, ζ,
              differ. We suggest that the sign of ζ depends on the penetration
              depth of the excess charge: for strong screening the electronic
              charge is located outside of the surface, and ζ is negative as
              found previously for clean metal surfaces. For weaker screening,
              the wider space charge layer implies a trend for the excess charge
              to fill bulk-like unoccupied states. These states are here
              antibonding, giving positive-valued ζ.",

              paramount in enhancing the efficiency of separation of valuable
              minerals from gangue using froth flotation. The contact angle
              value is a useful indicator providing the hydrophobic
              characteristic of the solid mineral surfaces due to a close
              relationship between this parameter and the floatability of
              minerals. In this paper, techniques for contact angle measurements
              and their applicability on mineral surfaces are reviewed. Two main
              groups of techniques for contact angle measurements are available;
              one group is applicable to flat and smooth surfaces while the
              other one has been especially developed for non-ideal surfaces or
              particles. Capillary penetration methods have been found to be
              more applicable than the other methods cited in measuring contact
              angles on real mineral surfaces. The major challenge with this
              technique is the modification required to overcome the
              difficulties in the experimental packing technique needed, and
              more importantly, to obtain the receding contact angle values. The
              coupling of accurate contact angle measurements with real (batch)

              optical properties in response to real-time temperature.
              Thermochromic glazing has been thoroughly advanced from a
              materials perspective, with many kinds of thermochromic coating
              techniques developed thus far, however, a far smaller body of work
              exists to investigate how these kinds of glazing would perform
              within buildings. This paper presents a systematic review of these
              thermochromic films, coatings and glazings that have been used to
              analyse primarily energy saving capability in buildings, using
              computer simulation as well as full-scale models. Research from
              2009 to 2019 was obtained from architecture and engineering
              databases, identifying window types modelled, energy savings
              found, and comfort analyses conducted. Thermochromic windows were
              reported to have the potential to save heating and cooling energy
              demand from 5.0 to 84.7\%, in comparison to plain glass and
              dependent on climatic conditions. Differences in energy saving
              capability were analysed based on location and glazing type.
              Thermochromic window energy performance was found to vary
              significantly between different cities using the same film type
              (up to 73.4\%), but far less so between different films types used
              in the same city (up to 21.6\%). Few studies were shown to have
              explored thermochromic windows from a visual and thermal comfort
              performance perspective. This paper highlights areas of guidance
              for future studies of thermochromic glazing for energy-efficient
              building applications to better forecast energy saving performance
              of thermochromic windows for real building application.",

               molecules constituting ambient air (H2O, O2, N2) while sodium
               ions were depleted from the surface region through diffusion into
               the bulk under an anodic potential. A sample poled in inert gas
               (Ar) was used for comparison. Systematic analyses of the chemical
               composition, thickness, silicate network, trapped molecular
               species, and hydrous species in the sodium-depleted layers
               revealed correlations between subsurface structural changes and
               mechanical properties such as hardness, elastic modulus, and
               fracture toughness. A silica-like structure was created in the

               processes are quantified, accounting for all incident solar
               radiation. An analytical approach is taken to highlight physical
               mechanisms, obscured in previous numerical studies. It is found
               that the free energy available per carrier is limited by a Carnot
               factor resulting from the conversion of thermal energy into
               entropy free work, a Boltzmann factor arising from the mismatch
               between absorption and emission angles and also carrier
               thermalisation. It is shown that in a degenerate band absorber, a
               free energy advantage is achieved over a discrete energy level
               absorber due to entropy transfer during carrier cooling. The
               non-absorption of photons with energy below the bandgap and
               photon emission from the device are shown to be current limiting
               processes. All losses are evaluated using the same approach
               providing a complete mathematical and graphical description of
               intrinsic mechanisms leading to limiting efficiency. Intrinsic
               losses in concentrator cells and spectrum splitting devices are

              are being reported globally and the number of cases of liver
              damage is still increasing in developing countries. On account of
              this, a series of epidemiologic surveys are being conducted to
              understand the degrees of liver damage caused by DMF exposure.
              Furthermore, many investigations have been performed to clarify
              the mechanism of DMF-induced liver toxicity using both human and
              experimental animal models. This review summarizes the current
              occupational cases reported on liver damage from workers exposed
              to DMF in industrial work places and the research results that
              account for DMF-induced liver failure and possible carcinogenesis.
              The findings reviewed here show the synergistic toxicity of DMF
              exposure with other toxicants, which might occur through
              complicated but distinct mechanisms, which may extend our
              knowledge for establishing risk assessments of DMF exposure in
              industrial work places.",

              structural features around the barrier layer of porous anodic
              alumina films formed in H2SO4 electrolyte at conditions different
              from those of best ordering. This is based on the combination of a
              suitable structural–kinetic model with the average size of
              imprints of barrier layer units on the Al surface determined by
              FESEM. The galvanostatic growth of films in steady state is
              accompanied by rise of anodic potential with time depending on
              temperature. Simultaneously structural features around the barrier
              layer like cell width, pore base diameter and barrier layer
              thickness increase with time and anodic potential. The ratios of
              their values remain constant in time but depend on temperature. A
              proportionality rule thus applies explained by demand for constant
              Al3+ and O2− transport numbers in steady state. The enlargement of
              the above structural features occurs simultaneously with
              termination of some pores due to their narrowing resulting from
              drop of ionic conductance in pores and/or barrier layer. The
              surface density of cells/pores across the film increases to film
              surface, where it becomes highest, established around the start of
              second transient stage. The porosity near barrier layer remains
              constant with time but increases with temperature. The anodising
              ratio and average field strength across the barrier layer
              generally slightly increases and decreases respectively with time
              while the relevant trends are affected by temperature. FESEM
              examination of film surfaces showed structure affected by
              metallurgical texture, altered however to deeper layers, and
              surface structure changes due to chemical attack of oxide by the

               electrical properties, which make them excellent photovoltaic
               materials. Pb-based halide perovskite solar cells, in particular,
               currently stand at a record efficiency of ≈23\%, fulfilling their
               potential toward commercialization. However, because of the
               toxicity concerns of Pb-based perovskite solar cells, their
               market prospects are hindered. In principle, Pb can be replaced
               with other less-toxic, environmentally benign metals. Sn-based
               perovskites are thus the far most promising alternative due to
               their very similar and perhaps even superior semiconductor
               characteristics. After years of effort invested in Sn-based

  abstract  = "Lead is a metal with many recognized adverse health side effects,
               and yet the molecular processes underlying lead toxicity are
               still poorly understood. Quantifying the injurious effects of
               lead is also difficult because of the diagnostic limitations that
               exist when analyzing human blood and urine specimens for lead
               toxicity. We analyzed the deleterious impact of lead on human
               cells by measuring its effects on cytokine production and gene
               expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lead activates
               the secretion of the chemokine IL-8 and impacts mitogen-dependent
               activation by increasing the secretion of the proinflammatory
               cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α and of the chemokines IL-8 and MIP1-α in
               the presence of phytohemagglutinin. The recorded changes in gene
               expression affected major cellular functions, including
               metallothionein expression, and the expression of cellular
               metabolic enzymes and protein kinase activity. The expression of
               31 genes remained elevated after the removal of lead from the
               testing medium thereby allowing for the measurement of adverse
               health effects of lead poisoning. These included thirteen
               metallothionein transcripts, three endothelial receptor B
               transcripts and a number of transcripts which encode cellular
               metabolic enzymes. Cellular responses to lead correlated with
               blood lead levels and were significantly altered in individuals
               with higher lead content resultantly affecting the nervous
               system, the negative regulation of transcription and the
               induction of apoptosis. In addition, we identified changes in
               gene expression in individuals with elevated zinc protoporphyrin
               blood levels and found that genes regulating the transmission of
               nerve impulses were affected in these individuals. The affected
               pathways were G-protein mediated signaling, gap junction
               signaling, synaptic long-term potentiation, neuropathic pain
               signaling as well as CREB signaling in neurons. Cellular
               responses to lead were altered in subjects with high zinc
               protoporphyrin blood levels. The results of our study defined
               specific changes in gene and protein expression in response to
               lead challenges and determined the injurious effects of exposures
               to lead on a cellular level. This information can be used for
               documenting the health effects of exposures to lead which will
               facilitate identifying and monitoring efficacious treatments for
               lead-related maladies.",

              Silver nanowires with independently controlled lengths and
              diameters were synthesized with a gram-scale polyol synthesis by
              controlling the reaction temperature and time. Characterization of
              films composed of nanowires of different lengths but the same
              diameter enabled the quantification of the effect of length on the
              conductance and transmittance of silver nanowire films.
              Finite-difference time-domain calculations were used to determine
              the effect of nanowire diameter, overlap, and hole size on the
              transmittance of a nanowire network. For individual nanowires with
              diameters greater than 50 nm, increasing diameter increases the
              electrical conductance to optical extinction ratio, but the
              opposite is true for nanowires with diameters less than this size.
              Calculations and experimental data show that for a random network
              of nanowires, decreasing nanowire diameter increases the number
              density of nanowires at a given transmittance, leading to improved
              connectivity and conductivity at high transmittance (>90\%). This

               The efficiency of SnS cells has been increasing steadily, but
               various loss mechanisms in the device, related to the presence of
               defects in the material, have so far limited it far below its

               characteristic absorption bands at 370 (PbI3−) and 425 nm

               volatility, leading to evaporation of volatile organic compounds
               to the atmosphere. Over the past two decades, ionic liquids (ILs)
               have gained enormous attention from the scientific community, and
               the number of reported articles in the literature has grown

               mainly due to their poor biodegradability, biocompatibility, and
               sustainability. An alternative to ILs are deep eutectic solvents
               (DES). Deep eutectic solvents are defined as a mixture of two or
               more components, which may be solid or liquid and that at a
               particular composition present a high melting point depression
               becoming liquids at room temperature. When the compounds that

               organic acids, sugars, or choline derivatives, the DES are so
               called natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES). NADES fully

              based materials such as nickel, its oxides, hydroxides as well as
              oxyhydroxides exhibit excellent electrocatalysis performances
              toward many small molecules, which are widely used for fuel cells,

              electrochemical sensors for pharmaceutical, medical, food or
              environmental analysis. Their electrocatalytic mechanisms are
              proposed from three aspects such as Ni(OH)2/NiOOH mediated
              electrolysis, direct electrocatalysis of Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH. Under
              exposure to air or aqueous solution, two distinct layers form on
              the Ni surface with a Ni hydroxide layer at the air-oxide
              interface and an oxide layer between the metal substrate and the
              outer hydroxide layer. The transformation from nickel or its
              oxides to hydroxides or oxyhydroxides could be further speeded up
              in the strong alkaline solution under the cyclic scanning at
              relatively high positive potential. The redox transition between
              Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH is also contributed to the electrocatalytic

              media. In addition, nickel based materials or nanomaterials, their

               GaN blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), phosphor-based solid-state
               white LEDs provide a much higher efficiency alternative to
               incandescent and fluorescent lighting, which are being broadly

               organic–inorganic lead halide-based perovskite crystals with

               thermally evaporated methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) on a lead

               species are present in the resulting material, while only one

               of the resulting molecules can be incorporated into the

              nickel hydroxide, an important material in physics and chemistry,
              that has many applications in engineering including,
              significantly, batteries. First, the structures of the two known
              polymorphs, denoted as α-Ni(OH)2 and β-Ni(OH)2, are described. The
              various types of disorder, which are frequently present in nickel
              hydroxide materials, are discussed including hydration, stacking
              fault disorder, mechanical stresses and the incorporation of ionic
              impurities. Several related materials are discussed, including
              intercalated α-derivatives and basic nickel salts. Next, a number
              of methods to prepare, or synthesize, nickel hydroxides are
              summarized, including chemical precipitation, electrochemical
              precipitation, sol-gel synthesis, chemical ageing, hydrothermal
              and solvothermal synthesis, electrochemical oxidation,
              microwave-assisted synthesis, and sonochemical methods. Finally,
              the known physical properties of the nickel hydroxides are
              reviewed, including their magnetic, vibrational, optical,
              electrical and mechanical properties. The last section in this
              paper is intended to serve as a summary of both the potentially
              useful properties of these materials and the methods for the
              identification and characterization of 'unknown' nickel

              actuating property of nanohoneycomb-structured nickel, with the
              actuation mechanism mainly due to a pseudocapacitive behavior by
              means of reversible faradic redox reactions. By using a
              dual-template synthesis method, a bilayered cantilever, comprising
              a nanohoneycomb layer backed by a solid layer of the same metal,
              was fabricated. Reversible bending of the cantilever upon cyclic
              potential triggering was observed. The strain of the cantilever
              increases nonlinearly with both potential and charge due to redox
              reactions. The maximum strain that can be achieved under a certain
              scan rate complies with a linear relationship with the capacity.
              Benefiting from the stable Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox couples at the

              the material has an unprecedentedly high charge-carrier mobility
              of 22 cm2 V-1 s-1 favoring efficient transport. In addition,
              FASnI3 exhibits strong radiative bimolecular recombination and
              Auger rates that are over an order of magnitude lower than for

              have recently emerged as a serious competitor for large scale and

              cells contain toxic lead, a sustainable procedure for handling the
              cells after their operational lifetime is required to prevent
              exposure of the environment to lead and to comply with

              report a procedure to remove every layer of the solar cells

              different materials. Besides isolating the toxic lead iodide in

              this way avoid lead waste. Furthermore, we show that the most

               now show power conversion efficiency of up to 22\%. However,
               these cells are facing issues towards commercialization, such as
               the need to achieve long-term stability and the development of a
               manufacturing method for the reproducible fabrication of
               high-performance devices. Here, we propose a strategy to obtain
               stable and commercially viable perovskite solar cells. A
               reproducible manufacturing method is suggested, as well as routes
               to manage grain boundaries and interfacial charge transport.
               Electroluminescence is regarded as a metric to gauge theoretical
               efficiency. We highlight how optimizing the design of device
               architectures is important not only for achieving high efficiency
               but also for hysteresis-free and stable performance. We argue
               that reliable device characterization is needed to ensure the
               advance of this technology towards practical applications. We
               believe that perovskite-based devices can be competitive with
               silicon solar modules, and discuss issues related to the safe
               management of toxic material. Perovskite solar cells have emerged
               as a potential low-cost alternative to existing technologies. In

              photovoltaic performance. The crystallization process and crystal
              shape of perovskites have striking impacts on their optoelectronic
              properties. Polycrystalline films and single crystals are two main
              forms of perovskites. Currently, perovskite thin films have been
              under intensive investigation while studies of perovskite single
              crystals are just in their infancy. This review article is
              concentrated upon the control of perovskite structures and growth,
              which are intimately correlated for improvements of not only solar
              cells but also light-emitting diodes, lasers, and photodetectors.
              We begin with the survey of the film formation process of
              perovskites including deposition methods and morphological
              optimization avenues. Strategies such as the use of additives,

               However, little is known about the chemical transformations that
               occur in the initial stages of perovskite crystal formation. Here
               we follow the real-time formation dynamics of MAPbI3 from a
               bilayer of lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI)

               lowering the substrate temperature during deposition, we are able
               to initially inhibit intermixing of the two layers. We
               subsequently use infrared and visible light transmission, X-ray
               diffraction, and photoluminescence lifetime measurements to
               reveal the room-temperature transformations that occur in vacuum
               and ambient air, as MAI diffuses into the PbI2 lattice to form
               MAPbI3. In vacuum, the transformation to MAPbI3 is incomplete as
               unreacted MAI is retained in the film. However, exposure to moist
               air allows for conversion of the unreacted MAI to MAPbI3,
               demonstrating that moisture is essential in making MAI more
               mobile and thus aiding perovskite crystallization. These dynamic
               processes are reflected in the observed charge-carrier lifetimes,
               which strongly fluctuate during periods of large ion migration

               next-generation photovoltaics. A unique class of materials, known
               as organic metal halide perovskites, bridges the gap between
               low-cost fabrication and exceptional device performance. These
               compounds can be processed at low temperature (typically in the
               range 80–150 °C) and readily self-assemble from the solution
               phase into high-quality semiconductor thin films. The low
               energetic barrier for crystal formation has mixed consequences.
               On one hand, it enables inexpensive processing and both optical
               and electronic tunability. The caveat, however, is that many
               as-formed lead halide perovskite thin films lack chemical and
               structural stability, undergoing rapid degradation in the
               presence of moisture or heat.To date, improvements in perovskite
               solar cell efficiency have resulted primarily from better control
               over thin film morphology, manipulation of the stoichiometry and
               chemistry of lead halide and alkylammonium halide precursors, and
               the choice of solvent treatment. Proper characterization and
               tuning of processing parameters can aid in rational optimization
               of perovskite devices. Likewise, gaining a comprehensive
               understanding of the degradation mechanism and identifying
               components of the perovskite structure that may be particularly
               susceptible to attack by moisture are vital to mitigate device
               degradation under operating conditions.This Account provides
               insight into the lifecycle of organic–inorganic lead halide
               perovskites, including (i) the nature of the precursor solution,
               (ii) formation of solid-state perovskite thin films and single
               crystals, and (iii) transformation of perovskites into hydrated
               phases upon exposure to moisture. In particular, spectroscopic
               and structural characterization techniques shed light on the
               thermally driven evolution of the perovskite structure. By tuning
               precursor stoichiometry and chemistry, and thus the lead halide
               charge-transfer complexes present in solution, crystallization
               kinetics can be tailored to yield improved thin film homogeneity.
               Because degradation of the as-formed perovskite film is in many
               ways analogous to its initial formation, the same suite of
               monitoring techniques reveals the moisture-induced transformation
               of low band gap methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) to wide
               band gap hydrate compounds. The rate of degradation is increased
               upon exposure to light. Interestingly, the hydration process is
               reversible under certain conditions. This facile formation and
               subsequent chemical lability raises the question of whether
               CH3NH3PbI3 and its analogues are thermodynamically stable phases,
               thus posing a significant challenge to the development of

               Whilst to date the focus has been on understanding and improving

              the range of accessible inorganic cores and tunable surface
              chemistries dramatically increased, expanding the set of
              nanocrystal arrangements experimentally attainable. In this

              bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed
              functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is
              often driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence
              of the assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader
              with a practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly,
              and superlattice characterization. We then summarize the theory of
              nanocrystal interactions and examine fundamental principles

               Here, we combine optical and electrical models using experimental

              to form small clusters and the sulfurization reaction to form
              planar MoS2 film is determined by the amount of background sulfur.

              However, depositing high-quality Sn-based perovskite films is
              still a challenge, particularly for low-temperature planar
              heterojunction (PHJ) devices. Here, a ``multichannel
              interdiffusion'' protocol is demonstrated by annealing stacked
              layers of aqueous solution deposited formamidinium iodide
              (FAI)/polymer layer followed with an evaporated SnI2 layer to
              create uniform FASnI3 films. In this protocol, tiny FAI crystals,

              multiple interdiffusion pathways for complete reaction with SnI2 .
              What is more, water, rather than traditional aprotic organic
              solvents, is used to dissolve the precursors. The best-performing
              FASnI3 PHJ solar cell assembled by this protocol exhibits a power

              diversity and product control increase substantially. Common
              structural motifs within these materials systems may be related to
              structural precursors in the melt that may be controlled by tuning
              reaction conditions and composition. Stabilization of a particular
              building block is often accomplished with tuning of the flux
              composition, which controls the Lewis basicity and redox
              potential. In such tunable and dynamic fluxes, the synthesis can
              be directed toward new materials. Using complementary techniques
              of in situ X-ray diffraction, we can create time-dependent maps of
              reaction space and probe the mobile species present in melts.
              Certain thoughts toward the ultimate goal of targeted materials
              synthesis by controlling inorganic melt chemistry are discussed.",

               considerable attention in recent years owing to their inexpensive
               and easy fabrication and rapidly increasing efficiencies, which
               already match those of the industrially dominant
               multi-crystalline silicon. The incorporation of perovskite
               absorber materials into multiple (multi-)junction cells could
               potentially allow us to go well beyond silicon-based technology
               and reach even higher power conversion efficiencies. Layering
               multiple solar-absorber junctions on top of each other enables
               the absorption of different regions of the solar spectrum, so
               that more energy can be extracted from sunlight. The possibility
               of tuning the bandgap of perovskite materials over a wide range,
               along with the ability to generate high open-circuit voltages
               from wide-bandgap absorbers, make perovskites ideal candidates.
               Perovskites can be used in combination with or as a substitute
               for silicon in photovoltaic technologies already in use and can
               be assembled in hybrid tandem architectures or layered in
               all-perovskite multi-junction cells. In this Review, we discuss
               opportunities for perovskite multi-junction cells, explore the
               progress made so far, describe the theoretical possibilities and
               discuss perspectives and challenges for the future of this
               emergent technology. The tunable bandgap of perovskites and their
               combination in multi-junction solar cells can afford highly

               emitter rear totally diffused (PERT), and silicon heterojunction
               (SHJ) solar cells. We compare measured temperature coefficients
               (TC) of the different electrical parameters with values collected
               from commercial module data sheets. While similar TC values of
               the open-circuit voltage and the short circuit current density

               systematically find that the TC under maximum power-point (MPP)

               to additional series resistance in the modules from solar cell
               interconnections. This detrimental effect can be reduced by using
               a cell design that exhibits a high characteristic load resistance
               (defined by its voltage-over-current ratio at MPP), such as the
               SHJ architecture. We calculate the energy yield for moderate and
               hot climate conditions for each cell architecture, taking into
               account ohmic cell-to-module losses caused by cell
               interconnections. Our calculations allow us to conclude that
               maximizing energy production in hot and sunny environments
               requires not only a high open-circuit voltage, but also a minimal
               series-to-load-resistance ratio.",

              also points out the important criteria for a good electrocatalyst

              current progress and offer a comprehensive insight toward the OER.
              This review begins with examining the theoretical principles of

              OER, and this information is crucial and can provide efficient
              strategies to design perfect electrocatalysts for OER. Finally,

              better than that of commercial catalysts like NiO, CoO and TiO2.
              The LDH has been characterized by using XRD, XPS, PL, TRES, EIS,
              TEM, SEM-EDX, AFM, UV-visible DRS, N2-sorption desorption,
              ξ-potential, FT-IR and TG techniques. The characterized results
              indicate that the LDH possesses hexagonal morphology, a high

               Although intensive investigations are being made on their
               technical feasibility, serious analysis on the cost of
               perovskite-based tandem modules is lacking. The levelized cost of
               electricity (LCOE) of solar modules is often used to evaluate
               technoeconomic competitiveness. Here, we performed a detailed
               cost analysis on two perovskite-based tandem modules (the
               perovskite/c-silicon and the perovskite/perovskite tandem module)
               compared with standard multi-crystalline silicon and
               single-junction perovskite solar cells. We found that perovskite
               PVs (both single junction and multi-junction) are competitive in
               the context of LCOE if the module lifetime is comparable with

               UV light and high temperatures have posed a major setback to
               their commercialization. Recently, mixed halide hybrid
               perovskites (MHHPs) where I− is substituted with Br− and Cl− have
               driven a paradigm shift in PSCs, synergistically combining high
               performance with high ambient stability. In this comprehensive
               review, we summarize the progress made in the past 5 years in
               methylammonium-based organic–inorganic MHHPs and cesium-based all
               inorganic MHHPs. We discuss the fabrication approaches for halide
               substitution and the resulting crystal structure, long-term
               stability and durability, and device performance. Unique from
               other reviews, we focus this review on the optical properties of
               MHHPs, including light-induced phase segregation and alterations
               in the optical band gap and photoluminescence with halide
               substitution. We also summarize trends in carrier dynamics,
               including carrier thermalization, recombination, and charge
               transfer probed with time-resolved optical spectroscopies.
               Furthermore, we provide a short overview on mixed cation hybrid
               perovskites, where methylammonium is substituted with
               formamidinium/cesium or Pb is substituted with less toxic and
               benign metals to improve both the stability and the environmental
               impact of PSCs. We discuss the optical characteristics of mixed
               cation perovskites and approaches to lower nonradiative
               recombination with cation substitution. We conclude this review
               with a discussion on innovative future directions that will
               propel research on MHHPs as a game changer in perovskite-based
               optoelectronics.",

               diodes, and flexible electronics. Though solvent–solute
               coordination plays a critical role in HOIP crystallization, the
               influence of solvent choice on such interactions is poorly
               understood. We demonstrate Gutmann’s donor number, DN, as a
               parameter that indicates the coordinating ability of the
               processing solvent with the Pb2+ center of the lead halide
               precursor. Low DN solvents interact weakly with the Pb2+ center,
               favoring instead complexation between Pb2+ and iodide and
               subsequent crystallization of perovskite. High DN solvents
               coordinate more strongly with the Pb2+ center, which in turn
               inhibits iodide coordination and stalls perovskite
               crystallization. Varying the concentration of high-DN additives
               in precursor solutions tunes the strength of lead–solvent
               interactions, allowing finer control over the crystallization and
               the resulting morphology of HOIP active layers.",

               biodegradability and biocompatibility, suggest that they are
               alternative candidates for concepts and applications involving
               some organic solvents and ionic liquids. Owing to the growing

               interest in the natural eutectic phenomenon, many NADES
               applications have been developed in the past several years.
               However, unlike organic solvents, the basic structural unit of
               NADES media primarily depends on the intermolecular interactions
               among their components. This makes NADES matrices readily
               influenced by various factors, such as water content,
               temperature, and component ratio and, thus, extends the

               understanding of the importance of NADES in biological systems,
               this review focuses on NADES properties and applications in NP

               evolution reaction (OER) has drawn huge attention, but its
               efficiency still falls short of expectations. A widely accepted
               speculation is that the catalysts’ activity is insufficient (high
               reaction barriers need to be overcome). Here, we develop a
               first-principles method to investigate the photocatalytic OER at
               the water/TiO2(110) interface. A full mechanism uncovering the
               importance of radicals is determined. Kinetic analysis further
               enables to quantitatively estimate each possible obstacle in the
               process. We demonstrate unambiguously that the rate-determining
               factor of the OER varies with the concentration of
               surface-reaching photoholes (Ch+). Under experimental conditions,
               the intrinsic catalytic activity of TiO2(110) does not represent
               the main obstacle, but all steps involving the photoholes are
               slow due to their low concentrations. This suggests that the key
               to enhance the OER efficiency is to increase Ch+ before Ch+
               reaches the estimated threshold (Ch+ = ~10−4). A high reaction
               barrier is often assumed as the limiting factor in photocatalytic
               oxygen evolution reactions on titanium dioxide. Now, it is shown

              design such an ideal catalyst, this work synthesized

              (g-C3N4@NiAl-LDH NCPs) with various g-C3N4 contents through a

              optimized by evaluating the impacts of type of dye (cationic and
              anionic), photocatalyst dosage, pH, and contact time. According to
              the results, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4@NiAl-LDH

              provide insight into the nature of the water-Ni(OH)2 interactions.
              The spectroscopic and dynamical behaviour of the intercalated

              findings reported for this material. The results presented here
              indicate that the water molecules interact non-covalently with
              Ni(OH)2, with a binding energy that is comparable in magnitude
              with that of the water dimer hydrogen bond. The presence of the
              intercalated species increases the distance between the Ni(OH)2
              layers such that the interlayer interactions are negligible. The
              weakening of the interlayer interactions facilitates the

               industrial applications. As an actuation system to drive such
               robots, here we report a biologically inspired bilayer structure
               that harnesses the environmental humidity energy, with ratchets
               to rectify the motion. We named this actuator-ratchet system the
               hygrobot. The actuator uses a hygroscopically responsive film
               consisting of aligned nanofibers produced by directional
               electrospinning, which quickly swells and shrinks in lengthwise
               direction in response to the change of humidity. The ratchets
               based on asymmetric friction coefficients rectify oscillatory
               bending motion in a directional locomotion. We mathematically
               analyzed the mechanical response of the hygrobot, which allowed
               not only prediction of its performance but also the optimal
               design to maximize the locomotion speed given geometric and
               environmental constraints. The hygrobot sterilized a trail across
               an agar plate without any artificial energy supply.",

               major challenges in its large-scale deployment is the material
               instability and hazardous lead waste. Several studies have
               identified that lead replacement with its other alternatives does
               not show the similar assurance. In this manuscript, we introduce
               the concept of recycling of the degraded perovskite film (PbI2),
               gaining back the initial optoelectronic properties as the best
               possible solution to avoid lead waste. The simple recycling
               procedure allows the utilization of some of the most expensive
               (fluorine-doped tin oxide), primary energy-consuming (TiO2), and
               toxic (Pb) parts of the solar cell, reducing the payback time
               even further. This addresses the major issues of instability and
               expensive toxic lead disposal, altogether. We have demonstrated
               the comparative study of feasibility of recycling in degraded
               perovskite films deposited by three different standard
               fabrication routes. Films fabricated via acetate route shows
               efficient recycling compared to the other routes, i.e., chloride
               and sequential deposition routes. Moreover, recycling in
               sequentially deposited films needs further optimization.",

               is the deposition of a low-bandgap absorber without damaging
               other device layers. Vapor deposition is thus an attractive
               method, obviating the need for optically lossy protective

               Here, we demonstrate a method to dual-source coevaporate
               low-bandgap perovskite films and devices. We used mixtures formed
               by melting of metal halides as a single-crucible source of Cs,
               Pb, and Sn cations. Surprisingly, when this melt was coevaporated

              (A) in 3D lead iodide perovskites (APbI3), an intriguing class of
              semiconductors for high-performance photovoltaics and
              optoelectronics. Here, we show the tolerance factor requirement is
              relaxed in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites, enabling the
              incorporation of a variety of larger cations beyond the
              methylammonium (MA), formamidinium, and cesium ions in the lead
              iodide perovskite cages for the first time. This is unequivocally
              confirmed with the single-crystal X-ray structure of newly
              synthesized guanidinium (GA)-based (n-C6H13NH3)2(GA)Pb2I7, which
              exhibits significantly enlarged and distorted perovskite cage

              accumulation and self-adjustable strain-balancing in 2D RP
              structures. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies show a large A
              cation significantly influences carrier dynamics and
              exciton-phonon interactions through modulating the inorganic
              sublattice. These results enrich the diverse families of

               gained considerable attention over the past decade because of
               their potentially low production cost, earth-abundant raw
               materials, ease of fabrication and ever-increasing
               power-conversion efficiencies of up to 25.2\%. This type of solar
               cells offers the promise of generating electricity at a more
               competitive unit price than traditional fossil fuels by 2035.
               Nevertheless, the best research-cell efficiencies are still below
               the theoretical limit defined by the Shockley–Queisser theory,
               owing to the presence of non-radiative recombination losses. In
               this Review, we analyse the predominant pathways that contribute
               to non-radiative recombination losses in perovskite solar cells
               and evaluate their impact on device performance. We then discuss
               how non-radiative recombination losses can be estimated through
               reliable characterization techniques and highlight some notable
               advances in mitigating these losses, which hint at pathways
               towards defect-free perovskite solar cells. Finally, we outline
               directions for future work that will push the efficiency of
               perovskite solar cells towards the radiative limit. Non-radiative
               recombination losses hinder the performance of perovskite solar
               cells, preventing them from reaching the Shockley–Queisser limit.

               non-radiative recombination losses and highlights notable
               advances in their characterization and mitigation.",

              of precursors is a method that results in very smooth and
              pinhole-free perovskite thin films and allows excellent control
              over film thickness and composition. However, for a deposition
              method to become industrially scalable, reproducible process
              control and high device yields are essential. Unfortunately, to
              date, the control and reproducibility of evaporating organic
              precursors such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) have proved
              extremely challenging. We show that the established method of
              controlling the evaporation rate of MAI with quartz microbalances
              (QMBs) is critically sensitive to the concentration of the
              impurities MAH2PO3 and MAH2PO2 that are usually present in MAI
              after synthesis. Therefore, controlling the deposition rate of MAI
              with QMBs is unreliable since the concentration of such impurities
              typically varies from one batch of MAI to another and even during
              the course of a deposition. However once reliable control of MAI
              deposition is achieved, we find that the presence of precursor
              impurities during perovskite deposition does not degrade the solar
              cell performance. Our results indicate that as long as precursor
              deposition rates are well controlled, physical vapor deposition
              will allow high solar cell device yields even if the purity of

               dependent on the morphology of initially deposited PbI2 precursor
               film. In this work, surface modification of titanium dioxide
               (TiO2) substrates with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) was
               performed to control the quality of the PbI2 and MAPbI3
               perovskite layers. Two small organic molecules, each with a
               different backbone, 3-aminopropanoic acid (APA) and
               4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), were selected and their solvation
               effects were also investigated. Small homogeneously distributed
               cracks were found in the PbI2 film produced from the modification
               with APA molecules in demethyl sulfoxide or ethanol solution,
               whereas films produced from modification with ABA molecules
               showed different effects. These small cavities act as pathway for
               MAI intercalation and facilate PbI2-to-MAPbI3 conversion, leading
               to PbI2-free perovskite film. The different morphologies were
               caused by different adsorption behaviors of each SAM on the TiO2
               surface. APA molecules interact with the hydroxyl groups of TiO2
               while ABA molecules do not. Therefore, with APA treatment, the
               perovskite solar cells showed improvements in power conversion
               efficiency in comparison to either the devices without surface
               modification or ones treated with ABA molecules. The reasons
               behind the enhancement are attributed to longer charge carrier
               lifetime and better charge transfer at the TiO2/APA/perovskite
               interface. The results imply that the choice selected for SAMs
               and their solvents are crucial to obtaining high quality
               perovskite layers and efficient perovskite solar cells.",

               engineering applications. The benefits of tubular actuators
               include (i) multiple actuation modes such as contraction,
               bending, and expansion; (ii) facile fabrication from a planar
               sheet; and (iii) a large interior space for accommodating
               additional components or for transporting fluids. Most recently
               developed soft tubular actuators are driven by pneumatics,
               hydraulics, or tendons. Each of these actuation modes has
               limitations including complex fabrication, integration, and
               nonuniform strain. Here, we design and construct soft tubular
               actuators using an emerging artificial muscle material that can
               be easily patterned with programmable strain: liquid crystal
               elastomer. Controlled by an externally applied electrical
               potential, the tubular actuator can exhibit multidirectional
               bending as well as large (~40\%) homogenous contraction. Using
               multiple tubular actuators, we build a multifunctional soft
               gripper and an untethered soft robot.",

               mainly focused on Pb4S3Br2, a chalcohalide phase unknown to date
               that does not belong to the ambient-pressure PbS-PbBr2 phase
               diagram. The Pb4S3Br2 nanocrystals herein feature a remarkably
               narrow size distribution (with a size dispersion as low as 5\%),
               a good size tunability (from 7 to ∼30 nm), an indirect bandgap,
               photoconductivity (responsivity = 4 ± 1 mA/W), and stability for
               months in air. A crystal structure is proposed for this new
               material by combining the information from 3D electron
               diffraction and electron tomography of a single nanocrystal,
               X-ray powder diffraction, and density functional theory
               calculations. Such a structure is closely related to that of the
               recently discovered high-pressure chalcohalide Pb4S3I2 phase, and
               indeed we were able to extend our synthesis scheme to Pb4S3I2
               colloidal nanocrystals, whose structure matches the one that has
               been published for the bulk. Finally, we could also prepare
               nanocrystals of Pb3S2Cl2, which proved to be a structural
               analogue of the recently reported bulk Pb3Se2Br2 phase. It is
               remarkable that one high-pressure structure (for Pb4S3I2) and two

               Pb4S3Br2 and Pb3S2Cl2) can be prepared on the nanoscale by
               wet-chemical approaches. This highlights the important role of
               colloidal chemistry in the discovery of new materials and

               ecological environment safety and the health of operators working
               in manufactory and labs. CsPbBr3-based solar cells have attracted
               increasing attention due to its high stability. Herein,
               high-quality CsPbBr3 films are prepared using all green solvents

               green solvent system of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with the
               addition of ?-butyrolactone is used for preparing PbBr2 solutions
               by matching the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) between PbBr2
               and the mixed solvent system. By optimizing the HSPs and

               emphasis laid on stability-related investigations, publications
               lack consistency in experimental procedures and parameters

               the field on procedures for testing perovskite solar cell
               stability, which are based on the International Summit on Organic
               Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols. We propose additional
               procedures to account for properties specific to PSCs such as ion
               redistribution under electric fields, reversible degradation and
               to distinguish ambient-induced degradation from other stress
               factors. These protocols are not intended as a replacement of the
               existing qualification standards, but rather they aim to unify
               the stability assessment and to understand failure modes.
               Finally, we identify key procedural information which we suggest
               reporting in publications to improve reproducibility and enable
               large data set analysis. Reliability of stability data for

               In particular, Cs2AgBiBr6 has been the subject of several studies
               because of its environmental stability, low toxicity, and its
               promising optoelectronic features. Despite these encouraging
               features, the performances of solar cells based on this double

               theoretical studies to show that the short electron diffusion
               length is one of the major causes for the limited performance of
               Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells. Using EQE measurements on semitransparent

               surface photovoltage measurements we correlate the limited
               electron diffusion length with a high density of electron traps.

               power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell and strong
               electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. Nonradiative losses in such

               quantify the radiative limit of Voc in a perovskite solar cell as
               a function of its absorber thickness. We correlate PCE and EL

               factors for a high Voc. With a certain increase in perovskite
               thickness, PCE improves but EL efficiency is compromised and vice

               minimizing nonradiative losses. The results demonstrate that

              account of their low toxicity and equally excellent properties.
              Here, we report the highly uniform lead-free Cs3Cu2I5 perovskite
              films with the long-term air-stability prepared by using methyl

              structure, surface morphology, bandgap, and optical property of
              the Cs3Cu2I5 perovskite films are investigated. Even though the
              Cs3Cu2I5 perovskite films prepared with or without anti-solvent
              demonstrate the same crystal structure of the orthorhombic phase,

              ~76.0\% and have a relatively smaller surface roughness ~17.5 nm.
              Most importantly, Cs3Cu2I5 perovskite films exhibited long-term
              air-stability, and the PLQY could still reach 76.3\% after storing

               functional PVA–DES nanofibers (PVA–DES–honey and PVA–DES–ASA)
               were observed and analyzed, which proved the successful
               preparation of functional PVA–DES nanofibers. NIH/3T3 and HepG2
               cells incubated on the nanofiber had more than 90\% of cell
               viability, suggesting our materials were biocompatible and
               non-toxic. The nanofiber materials dissolved rapidly in

               materials for fast dissolving drug delivery in oral cavities. The
               honey incorporated PVA nanofiber (PVA–DES–honey) showed a total
               bacterial reduction of 37.0\% and 37.9\% against E. coli and S.

               cultures. Furthermore, in vivo study proved that the
               PVA–DES–honey nanofibers accelerated the wound healing process,
               and they improved the wound healing rate on rat skin to 85.2\%
               after 6 days of surgery, when compared to the control PVA
               (68.2\%) and PVA–DES (76.3\%) nanofibers. Overall, the nanofiber
               materials reported in our study showed potential as a green and
               biocompatible fast-dissolving drug delivery system and can be
               used for pharmaceutical fields, such as antibacterial wound

              related to the stability under various conditions and toxicity
              issues. A huge number of articles have been published in PSCs in
              the recent years focusing these issues by employing different
              strategies in the synthesis of electron transport layer (ETL),
              active perovskite layer, hole transport layer (HTL) and back
              contact counter electrodes. This article tends to focus on the
              role and classification of different materials used as HTL in
              influencing long-term stability, in improving the photovoltaic
              parameters and thereby enhancing the device efficiency. Hole
              Transport Materials (HTMs) are categorized by dividing into three
              primary types, namely; organic, inorganic and carbonaceous HTMs.
              To analyze the role of HTM in detail, we further divide these
              primary type of HTMs into different subgroups. The organic-based
              HTMs are subdivided into three categories, namely; long polymer
              HTMs, small molecule HTMs and cross-linked polymers and the
              inorganic HTMs have been classified into nickel (Ni) derivatives
              and copper (Cu) derivatives based HTMs, p-type semiconductor based
              HTMs and transition metal based HTMs. We further analyze the dual
              role of carbonaceous materials as HTM and counter electrode in the
              perovskite devices. In addition, in this review, an overview of
              the preparation methods, and the influence of the thickness of the
              HTM layers on the performance and stability of the perovskite
              devices are also provided. We have carried out a detailed
              comparison about the various classification of HTMs based on their
              cost-effectiveness and considering their role on effective device
              performance. This review further discusses the critical challenges
              involved in the synthesis and device engineering of HTMs. This

               perovskite solar cells, optimizing the morphology of perovskite
               material has become imperative to achieve high power conversion
               efficiencies. Despite the fact that nucleation plays a key role
               in controlling the crystal morphology, very little is known about
               the nucleation and crystal growth processes. Here, we perform
               metadynamics simulations of nucleation of methylammonium lead
               triiodide (MAPI) in order to unravel the atomistic details of
               perovskite crystallization from a γ-butyrolactone solution. The
               metadynamics trajectories show that the nucleation process takes
               place in several stages. Initially, dense amorphous clusters
               mainly consisting of lead and iodide appear from the homogeneous
               solution. These clusters evolve into lead iodide (PbI2)-like
               structures. Subsequently, methylammonium (MA+) ions diffuse into
               these PbI2-like aggregates triggering the transformation into a
               perovskite crystal through a solid–solid transformation. These
               enticing results allowed us to design new experimental strategies
               to rationally control the dimensions of MAPI grains using the
               spin-coating technique and to engineer homogeneous nucleation and
               growth of MAPI single crystals. The experimental results amply

               demand, which are being exacerbated by population growth and
               industrialization in developing countries. The energy demand

               energy sources in order to avoid an imminent energy crisis in the

               energy needs are fulfilled by photoinduced or electrochemical
               water-splitting, storing solar energy as hydrogen and dioxygen
               gas, and releasing the chemical energy in fuel cells while
               regenerating water. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
               and the oxygen reduction reaction taking place respectively in
               water-splitting and fuel cells are quite sluggish because of
               their multielectronic and multiprotonic nature. Catalysts such as

               electrocatalysts but such noble metal-based materials are
               severely limited by their scarcity and high cost. Thus, noble
               metal free electro/photocatalysts are being eagerly pursued to
               provide more sustainable alternatives. In this context,
               vanadium-based and vanadium-containing electro and photocatalysts
               based on hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/oxides, vanadates,
               chalcogenides and nitrides stand out among the most promising
               alternatives, and recent advances have demonstrated their key
               role in enhancing the catalytic activity by strong synergic
               electronic and structural effects. In fact, such high-performance
               materials have potential in the fabrication of fuel cells and

              inorganic solids has been shown to exhibit a dynamical transition
              upon supercooling. However, understanding the extent of the
              underlying surface hydrophilicity as well as the local
              distribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic patches on the dynamical
              transition is unexplored. Here, we use molecular dynamics
              simulations with a TIP4P/2005 water model to study the
              translational and rotational relaxation dynamics of interfacial
              water on graphene surfaces. The purpose of this study is to
              investigate the influence of both the surface chemistry and the
              extent of hydration on the rotational transitions of interfacial
              water on graphene oxide (GO) surfaces in the deeply supercooled
              region. We have considered three graphene-based surfaces: a GO
              surface with equal proportions of oxidized and pristine graphene
              regions in a striped topology, a fully oxidized surface and a
              pristine graphene surface. The dipole relaxation time of
              interfacial water (high hydration) shows a strong-to-strong
              transition, strong nature, and strong-to-strong transition on
              these surfaces, respectively, in the temperature range of 210-298
              K. In contrast, bulk water shows a fragile-to-strong rotational
              transition upon supercooling. In all these cases at high
              hydration, interfacial water co-exists with a thick water film
              with bulk-like properties. To investigate the influence of bulk
              water on dynamical transitions, we simulated a low hydration
              regime where only bound water (surface water) is present on the GO
              surfaces and found that the rotational relaxation of surface water
              on both the GO and fully oxidized surfaces shows a single
              Arrhenius temperature dependence. Bulk water is found to have a
              greater influence on the rotational relaxation in the presence of
              a hydrophobic surface and the dipole angular distributions show
              distinct differences on the surfaces upon supercooling. Our
              results indicate that not only does the local extent of surface
              hydrophilicity play a role in determining the energy landscape
              explored by the water molecules upon supercooling, but the
              presence of bulk water also modulates the dynamic transition.",

               because of the possible flexible substitution of numerous ions in

               due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties in solar
               cells, photodetectors, lasers, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
               Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are highly tolerant to defects,
               unlike metal chalcogenides, and do not require surface
               passivation to retain high quantum yields. Interestingly, the
               defect structures and trap states in perovskites are often found
               only in their conduction and/or valence bands and not in the
               mid-states of the bandgap. Such characteristics essentially boost
               their properties and largely favor their sensing applications.
               Perovskites have thus been attempted by numerous groups to
               address the serious concern of heavy metal ions, biomolecules,

               prints can be obtained through patterning photonic hydrogels with
               different responsive polymers. Yet, the visibility of the
               revealed prints is still not satisfactory due to the limited
               contrast between the responsive and non-responsive regions. In
               this study, we report revealable photonic prints with high
               visibility by patterning photonic hydrogels with two oppositely
               pH-responsive polymers comprising weak acidic and weak basic
               groups. The two distinct pH-responsive polymers can be protonated
               and deprotonated in the same environment, triggering the
               variation of colors from the initial state to the opposite
               directions in the different regions of the photonic prints.
               Therefore, the contrast of the photonic patterns is greatly
               improved, increasing the naked-eye detection range of
               colorimetric sensing. This study provides a new opportunity for
               designing patterned photonic materials for use in improved visual
               sensors.",

               understood. In this paper, the relationship between photovoltaic
               performance and carrier dynamics is systematically studied in
               both TiO2- and SnO2-based planar perovskite devices. It is found

               More importantly, the trap-state density is characterized, which

              optoelectronic properties that underpin this performance, clearly
              differentiating between intrinsic and defect-mediated mechanisms.
              We show that from a fundamental perspective, increasing tin
              fraction may cause increases in attainable charge-carrier
              mobilities, decreases in exciton binding energies, and potentially
              a slowing of charge-carrier cooling, all beneficial for
              photovoltaic applications. We discuss the mechanisms leading to
              significant bandgap bowing along the tin-lead series, which
              enables attractive near-infrared bandgaps at intermediate tin
              content. However, tin-rich stoichiometries still suffer from tin
              oxidation and vacancy formation which often obscures the
              fundamentally achievable performance, causing high background hole
              densities, accelerating charge-carrier recombination, lowering
              charge-carrier mobilities, and blue-shifting absorption onsets
              through the Burstein-Moss effect. We evaluate impacts on
              photovoltaic device performance, and conclude with an outlook on
              remaining challenges and promising future directions in this area.",

               stability in air, and recent demonstrations of long
               charge-carrier lifetimes that can exceed 1 µs. In particular,
               Cs2AgBiBr6 is the subject of many investigations in photovoltaic
               devices. However, the efficiencies of solar cells based on this
               double perovskite are still far from the theoretical efficiency
               limit of the material. Here, the role of grain size on the
               optoelectronic properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films is
               investigated. It is shown through cathodoluminescence
               measurements that grain boundaries are the dominant nonradiative
               recombination sites. It also demonstrates through field-effect
               transistor and temperature-dependent transient current
               measurements that grain boundaries act as the main channels for
               ion transport. Interestingly, a positive correlation between
               carrier mobility and temperature is found, which resembles the
               hopping mechanism often seen in organic semiconductors. These

               Upon MoO3 deposition, significant chemical interaction is induced
               at the MoO3/MAPbI3–xClx interface: substoichiometric molybdenum

               however, employ infinitesimal core–shell QDs which inherently
               have different electron and hole mobilities. As QDs are the core
               building blocks of QD-LEDs, the inherent mobility difference in
               the core–shell QDs causes significantly unbalanced charge carrier
               transport, resulting in detrimental effects on performances of
               QD-LEDs. Herein, we introduce a post-chemical treatment to
               reconstruct the QD films through the solvent-mediated
               self-organization process. The treatment using various poly-alkyl
               alcohol groups enables QD ensembles to transform from disordered

               modulate electron and hole mobilities, which leads to the

               essential for the development of all-perovskite tandem solar
               cells, however they are currently limited by significant
               short-circuit current losses despite their near optimal bandgap
               (≈1.25 eV). Herein, the origin of these losses is investigated,
               using a combination of voltage dependent photoluminescence (PL)
               timeseries and various charge extraction measurements. It is
               demonstrated that the Pb/Sn-perovskite devices suffer from a
               reduction in the charge extraction efficiency within the first
               few seconds of operation, which leads to a loss in current and
               lower maximum power output. In addition, the emitted PL from the
               device rises on the exact same timescales due to the accumulation
               of electronic charges in the active layer. Using transient charge
               extraction measurements, it is shown that these observations
               cannot be explained by doping-induced electronic charges but by
               the movement of mobile ions toward the perovskite/transport layer
               interfaces, which inhibits charge extraction due to band
               flattening. Finally, these findings are generalized to lead-based
               perovskites, showing that the loss mechanism is universal. This
               elucidates the negative role mobile ions play in perovskite solar
               cells and paves a path toward understanding and mitigating a key
               loss mechanism.",

               recognized as a promising platform for high-performance
               optoelectronic devices, featuring high crystallinity and
               stability. However, a high trap density and structural
               nonuniformity at the surface have been major barriers to the
               progress of single crystal-based optoelectronic devices. Here,
               the formation of a unique nanoisland structure is reported at the
               surface of the facet-controlled cuboid MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+)
               single crystals through a cation interdiffusion process enabled
               by energetically vaporized CsI. The interdiffusion of mobile ions
               between the bulk and the surface is triggered by thermally
               activated CsI vapor, which reconstructs the surface that is rich
               in MA and CsI with reduced dangling bonds. Simultaneously, an
               array of Cs-Pb-rich nanoislands is constructed on the surface of
               the MAPbI3 single crystals. This newly reconstructed nanoisland
               surface enhances the light absorbance over 50\% and increases the
               charge carrier mobility from 56 to 93 cm2 V?1 s?1. As confirmed
               by Kelvin probe force microscopy, the nanoislands form a gradient
               band bending that prevents recombination of excess carriers, and
               thus, enhances lateral carrier transport properties. This unique
               engineering of the single crystal surface provides a pathway
               towards developing high-quality perovskite single-crystal surface

               hurdle in the path towards PSC's commercialization; tin
               (Sn)-based PSCs outperform the reported Pb-free perovskites in
               terms of photovoltaic performance. However, it is of a
               particularly great challenge to develop effective passivation
               strategies to suppress Sn(II) induced defect densities and
               oxidation for attaining high-performance all-inorganic CsSnI3
               PSCs. Herein, a facile yet effective thioamides passivation
               strategy to modulate defect state density at surfaces and grain
               boundaries in CsSnI3 perovskites is reported. The
               thiosemicarbazide (TSC) with S?C?N functional groups can make
               strong coordination interaction with charge defects, leading to
               enhanced electron cloud density around defects and increased
               vacancy formation energies. Importantly, the surface passivation
               can reduce the deep level trap state defect density originated
               from undercoordinated Sn2+ ion and Sn2+ oxidation, significantly
               restraining nonradiative recombination and elongating the carrier

               all-inorganic CsSnI3 PSCs based on an inverted configuration
               delivers a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.20\%,

  abstract  = "ConspectusPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have, in recent years,
               become one of the most in-depth photovoltaic materials in many
               different disciplines due to their long-range charge carrier
               diffusion lengths, strong light absorption, easy tuning of the
               band gaps, low defect density, and solution processability. The
               power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has
               reached a certified value of 25.5\%, which has caught up with or
               even surpassed traditional photovoltaic technologies, such as
               silicon (Si) solar cells, thin film solar cell, etc. In addition
               to the performance of PSCs comparable to traditional photovoltaic
               technology, its biggest feature is that it can be prepared by a
               solution method. The preparation process of the solution method
               simplify the film preparation process and greatly reduce the
               preparation cost. In addition, the solution method provides a
               favorable option for the energy supply of flexible wearable
               devices in the future.At present, the preparation of PSCs mainly
               uses organic molecular solvents, including N,N-dimethylformamide
               (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and
               their mixed solvents. However, most of these commonly used
               organic solvents are unsafe and are likely to cause water and
               soil pollution, harm to the human body, and safety accidents. In
               addition, most solvents have a high coordination number, which
               limits the crystallization of perovskite. Furthermore,
               high-quality perovskite films require the introduction of a large
               amount of high boiling point, polar and aprotic antisolvents to
               assist crystallization, such as chlorobenzene, ether, and ethyl
               acetate. In addition to the toxicological problems of the
               antisolvent, the technology has a relatively narrow operating
               time window, relatively high operating environment requirements,
               and relatively low repeatability, which greatly limits the
               large-scale production of PSCs. Therefore, It is very necessary
               to develop a new solvent engineering technology for PSCs, which
               is green and pollution-free, is a simple process, and has high
               efficiency, long-term stability, and low cost. Recently, we have
               developed a series of ionic liquids, including MAAc, MAFa, BAAc,
               etc., which can be used as solvents to prepare efficient and
               stable PSCs. It allows the production of smooth and continuous
               polycrystalline perovskite thin films in ambient air through a
               simple spin coating methodIn this Account, we started with the
               discovery of ionic liquids as solvents to PSCs. We have proposed
               new strategies for improving and enhancing ionic liquid-based
               PSCs, including interface engineering, solvent engineering, and
               additive engineering. Furthermore, the stable and efficient
               mechanism of ionic liquid-based perovskite solar cells has been
               revealed. In view of the designable characteristics of ionic
               liquids, some functional ionic liquids have been designed and
               applied to different systems of halide perovskites, which has
               important guiding significance for the development of more
               functional ionic liquids for PSCs. Finally, the challenges and
               future directions of ionic liquid-based PSCs from both
               large-scale production and technological perspectives are
               proposed to provide a new method for the commercialization of

  abstract  = "ConspectusPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have, in recent years,
               become one of the most in-depth photovoltaic materials in many
               different disciplines due to their long-range charge carrier
               diffusion lengths, strong light absorption, easy tuning of the
               band gaps, low defect density, and solution processability. The
               power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has
               reached a certified value of 25.5\%, which has caught up with or
               even surpassed traditional photovoltaic technologies, such as
               silicon (Si) solar cells, thin film solar cell, etc. In addition
               to the performance of PSCs comparable to traditional photovoltaic
               technology, its biggest feature is that it can be prepared by a
               solution method. The preparation process of the solution method
               simplify the film preparation process and greatly reduce the
               preparation cost. In addition, the solution method provides a
               favorable option for the energy supply of flexible wearable
               devices in the future.At present, the preparation of PSCs mainly
               uses organic molecular solvents, including N,N-dimethylformamide
               (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and
               their mixed solvents. However, most of these commonly used
               organic solvents are unsafe and are likely to cause water and
               soil pollution, harm to the human body, and safety accidents. In
               addition, most solvents have a high coordination number, which
               limits the crystallization of perovskite. Furthermore,
               high-quality perovskite films require the introduction of a large
               amount of high boiling point, polar and aprotic antisolvents to
               assist crystallization, such as chlorobenzene, ether, and ethyl
               acetate. In addition to the toxicological problems of the
               antisolvent, the technology has a relatively narrow operating
               time window, relatively high operating environment requirements,
               and relatively low repeatability, which greatly limits the
               large-scale production of PSCs. Therefore, It is very necessary
               to develop a new solvent engineering technology for PSCs, which
               is green and pollution-free, is a simple process, and has high
               efficiency, long-term stability, and low cost. Recently, we have
               developed a series of ionic liquids, including MAAc, MAFa, BAAc,
               etc., which can be used as solvents to prepare efficient and
               stable PSCs. It allows the production of smooth and continuous
               polycrystalline perovskite thin films in ambient air through a
               simple spin coating methodIn this Account, we started with the
               discovery of ionic liquids as solvents to PSCs. We have proposed
               new strategies for improving and enhancing ionic liquid-based
               PSCs, including interface engineering, solvent engineering, and
               additive engineering. Furthermore, the stable and efficient
               mechanism of ionic liquid-based perovskite solar cells has been
               revealed. In view of the designable characteristics of ionic
               liquids, some functional ionic liquids have been designed and
               applied to different systems of halide perovskites, which has
               important guiding significance for the development of more
               functional ionic liquids for PSCs. Finally, the challenges and
               future directions of ionic liquid-based PSCs from both
               large-scale production and technological perspectives are
               proposed to provide a new method for the commercialization of

              the photovoltaic performance. Here, we report on micro-wrinkled
              perovskite layers to enhance photocarrier transport performances.
              By utilizing temperature-dependent miscibility of dimethyl

              wrinkles of the perovskite films are controlled. Wrinkling is

              longer carrier lifetime at the hill sites than at the valley

               charge-carrier dynamics and transport properties are investigated
               across five compositions along the AgBiI4?CuI solid solution line
               (stoichiometry Cu4x(AgBi)1?xI4). The presence of a close-packed
               iodide sublattice is found to provide a good backbone for general
               semiconducting properties across all of these materials, whose

               increasing copper content, which enhances photoluminescence

               photoexcitation-energy-dependent terahertz photoconductivity

               essential for the development of all-perovskite tandem solar
               cells, however they are currently limited by significant
               short-circuit current losses despite their near optimal bandgap
               (≈1.25 eV). Herein, the origin of these losses is investigated,
               using a combination of voltage dependent photoluminescence (PL)
               timeseries and various charge extraction measurements. It is
               demonstrated that the Pb/Sn-perovskite devices suffer from a
               reduction in the charge extraction efficiency within the first
               few seconds of operation, which leads to a loss in current and
               lower maximum power output. In addition, the emitted PL from the
               device rises on the exact same timescales due to the accumulation
               of electronic charges in the active layer. Using transient charge
               extraction measurements, it is shown that these observations
               cannot be explained by doping-induced electronic charges but by
               the movement of mobile ions toward the perovskite/transport layer
               interfaces, which inhibits charge extraction due to band
               flattening. Finally, these findings are generalized to lead-based
               perovskites, showing that the loss mechanism is universal. This
               elucidates the negative role mobile ions play in perovskite solar
               cells and paves a path toward understanding and mitigating a key

              segregation. Here we employ optical-pump terahertz-probe

              the charge-carrier dynamics and transport properties of mixed

              not strongly localised. We further demonstrate enhanced lattice
              anharmonicity in the segregated I-rich domains, which is likely to
              support ionic migration. These phonon anharmonicity effects also
              serve as evidence of a remarkably fast, picosecond charge

               highest power-conversion efficiency already reaching 25.6\%. Much

               high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is to employ
               additives as crystallization agents or to passivate defects.
               Tri-iodide ion has been known as an efficient additive to improve
               the crystallinity, grain size, and morphology of perovskite
               films. However, the generation and control of this tri-iodide ion
               are challenging. Herein, an efficient method to produce
               tri-iodide ion in a precursor solution using a photoassisted
               process for application in PSCs is developed. Results suggest
               that the tri-iodide ion can be synthesized rapidly when
               formamidinium iodide (FAI) dissolved isopropyl alcohol (IPA)

               However, fabrication of DES-based SLMs is challenging and highly
               dependent on the fabrication parameters: DES properties and
               properties of membrane supports. Subsequently, the fabrication
               methods, immersion, pressure-based impregnation and vacuum
               filtration also affect the permeation performance of DES-based
               SLMs in liquids and gases separation. Furthermore, the SLM

               method to obtain performance and stability enhancements in PSCs,
               demonstrating their methodology as a convenient, scalable, and
               reproducible post-deposition treatment for PSCs. Their results
               identify improvements in crystallinity and grain size,

              The development of novel strategies and materials to improve the
              stability of small and large solar modules without compromising
              power conversion efficiency (PCE) is an ongoing challenge. Ionic
              liquids (ILs) are emerging as useful additives, solvents, and
              charge transport materials for the preparation of highly efficient
              perovskite films. Perovskite crystallizes slowly in ILs to form
              large and uniform grains, and PSCs fabricated with high-quality
              perovskite films are efficient and stable. Herein we review
              recently developed systemic device engineering, and we discuss the
              impact of ILs in the production of highly efficient and stable
              PSCs. This review is intended to serve as a guide to develop
              highly crystalline perovskite films with larger grains and more
              homogeneous morphologies, all of which contribute to enhancing the
              stability of PSC performance. Recent progress in the use of ILs as

              developing reliable perovskite photovoltaic devices. Finally, we

               absorbers that have the capability to be integrated into
               cost-efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly solar cells.
               The ternary chalcogenide AgBiS2 exhibits unique properties, such
               as having a tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and
               environmental stability, together with easy processability, and
               it has attracted the attention of the research community over the

               conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26\% for these emerging
               nanocrystals, experimentally they have not been able to go beyond

               level of density functional theory (DFT) has been subject of
               several studies but still presents significant problems and
               deviations from experimental values. Various approaches have been
               proposed, including the use of system-specific hybrid functionals
               with a variable amount of exact exchange or the explicit
               inclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects. In this work, we
               present a pragmatic recipe to compute the band gap of halide
               perovskites with a minimum average error. The recipe is tested on
               a set of 36 halide perovskites of the type ABX3 [A = Cs,
               methyl-ammonium (MA), and formamidinium (FA); B = Ge, Sn, and Pb;
               and X = Cl, Br, and I] for which experimental estimates of the
               band gap have been reported in the literature. Upon assessment of
               the accuracy of commonly used DFT functionals and the analysis of
               their performances based on error and statistical analysis, we
               suggest a strategy to compute band gaps in halide perovskites
               with a single functional. This is based on the use of the hybrid
               HSE06 functional where SOC is included exclusively for
               Pb-containing compounds. The results are rationalized in terms of
               the materials’ chemical nature and are corroborated by the
               prediction of their expected efficiencies in solar cells. The
               calculated efficiencies from band gaps obtained with the proposed
               approach closely follow the experimental trend, demonstrating the
               importance of adopting a reliable but material-independent
               computational strategy to screen new halide perovskite materials

               promising path to achieve low-cost, high-efficiency lead-free
               optoelectronic devices, in particular solar cells. These
               materials present tunable gaps within the visible range, high
               short-circuit currents, and interesting efficiencies in outdoor
               and indoor devices. Herein, a combination of symmetry analysis
               and first-principles calculations is used to explore the
               structural, electronic, and optical properties of prototypical
               rudorffites solar cell absorbers AgBiI4 and Ag3BiI6. The
               challenges to model those ternary materials are first
               established. It is shown that Ag/Bi double salts cannot be
               modeled as random alloys. Second, a Wyckoff position splitting
               method is developed leading to the generation of model
               structures, which are unique for each compound, and agrees with
               experimental structural data. These structures are used to
               establish the optoelectronic properties of AgBiI4 and Ag3BiI6.
               Finally, the ideal photovoltaic performance of the materials is
               predicted through the spectral limited maximum efficiency
               approach. It is shown that AgBiI4 presents a slightly higher
               potential for solar cell applications, and the realized devices
               are mostly limited by the low open-circuit voltage. The
               structural models developed here can help unveiling complex
               properties of the materials and explore substitutional

               due to their skyrocketing power conversion; however, their
               reported fill factors (FFs) still lag behind those of
               commercialized solar cells, and there is a lack of a
               comprehensive understanding of the mechanism. Here, we employed a
               facile and effective strategy to improve the FF to 96.3\% of the
               Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit through homogeneous incorporation

               hole mobility to balance with electron mobility. As a result, the
               non-radiative recombination is suppressed along with enhanced
               carrier extraction efficiency, resulting in a remarkable PCE of
               25.09\% (certified: 24.66\%) with a record FF of 86.9\%, which is
               the highest FF among those of the reported PSCs. An in-depth

               non-radiative recombination. This work provides an efficient

               has risen rapidly, but continuing this trend requires a clear
               view of all possible sources of power loss. Over the past decade
               in which we have witnessed these remarkable improvements, the
               transparent conductive oxide (TCO) has been widely treated as an
               extrinsic element. While it is recognised that the TCO
               contributes power loss due to finite lateral resistance and
               optical losses, comparatively little attention has been paid to
               the influence of the TCO on the electrostatics in other cell
               layers. However, a recent fill factor (FF) record on a
               centimetre-scale PSC has refocused attention on how the TCO can
               play a significant role in the optoelectronic properties across
               the entire TCO-transport layer-perovskite interface. Primarily,
               this is the consequence of the Schottky-type heterojunction
               formed between the TL and TCO layers, which establishes a
               space-charge region within the TL. Due to the extreme thinness of
               many TL layers, the space charge region can extend the full width
               of the TL and even into the perovskite layer itself. In effect,
               the bulk properties of the TL come to be dominated by the
               equilibrium conditions of this junction, with the consequence
               that the TL can be markedly less conductive once in situ within a
               PSC. This in situ resistance can significantly reduce FF, but
               without knowledge of this mechanism, the source of resistance and
               FF loss would be non-obvious. In this contribution, we employ
               ionic–electronic device models to quantify the TCO-induced in
               situ conductance of the transport layer and demonstrate its
               characteristic appearance in the JV curves of high-performance
               PSCs. We posit that widely used titanium dioxide (TiO2) can be
               particularly susceptible to a low in situ conductance, which
               explains the years-long plateau of FFs in TiO2-based PSCs in the
               low 80\%-range. By comparison to inverted PSCs, we illustrate how
               the TCO influence can explain comparative underperformance of FF
               relative to open-circuit voltage and photocurrent in
               state-of-the-art n–i–p PSCs. We hope that by refocusing attention
               on this factor of PSC design, this work can provide a facile path
               to plausibly lifting single junction PSCs beyond 26\% efficiency.",

              defects in binary rock-salt materials were studied using the
              first-principles method. A novel, stable, and energetically
              competitive interstitial site (base-interstitial) was identified
              for anion interstitials in rock-salts. The formation energies of
              base-interstitial defects were compared with well-explored
              tetrahedral (body-interstitial) and split interstitials and were
              found to be energetically highly competitive. For alkali halides
              and silver bromide, the lowest formation energies are associated
              with the base-interstitial site and the split interstitial, which
              are therefore the predominant interstitial sites. However, split
              interstitials were found to be the energetically preferred
              configuration in metal monochalcogenide systems. Electronic band
              structures are affected by the presence of interstitial defects in
              rock-salt structures. In particular, the Fermi level is shifted
              below the valence band maxima for the body, base, and split
              interstitials in metal halides, indicating p-type conductivity.
              However, the Fermi level remains within the bandgap for metal
              monochalcogenides, indicating no preferred conductivity for base-
              and split-interstitial defects. Allowing the defects to be charged

               challenging. Herein, the influence of impurities on the
               evaporation dynamics of MAI is analyzed. It is proved that MAI
               heated in a high vacuum, depending on the purity, either
               undergoes a sublimation with a subsequent desublimation or a
               chemical decomposition with a following reverse reaction, leading
               to solid MAI in both cases. In situ mass spectrometry enables us
               to show that low purity MAI containing water and methylammonium
               phosphite impurities mainly sublimes, which results in a
               directional and by crystal microbalances traceable evaporation.
               In contrast, high purity MAI sublimes at higher temperatures and
               tends to form decomposition products such as methylamine and
               hydrogen iodide, which omnidirectional diffuse and can react with

               influence of a hole-transport layer, necessary for a full device,
               by monitoring halide segregation through in situ, concurrent
               X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements to
               disentangle compositional and optoelectronic changes. This work
               demonstrates that top coating FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(Br0.4I0.6)3
               perovskite films with a poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA) hole-extraction
               layer surprisingly leads to suppression of halide segregation
               because photogenerated charge carriers are rapidly trapped at
               interfacial defects that do not drive halide segregation.
               However, the generation of iodide-enriched regions near the

               PTAA layer through improved energy level offsets, increasing

               because of their high stability, all-inorganic composition, and
               advantageous optoelectronic properties. In this study,
               charge-carrier dynamics and transport properties are investigated
               across five compositions along the AgBiI4?CuI solid solution line
               (stoichiometry Cu4x(AgBi)1?xI4). The presence of a close-packed
               iodide sublattice is found to provide a good backbone for general
               semiconducting properties across all of these materials, whose
               optoelectronic properties are found to improve markedly with
               increasing copper content, which enhances photoluminescence
               intensity and charge-carrier transport. Photoluminescence and
               photoexcitation-energy-dependent terahertz photoconductivity
               measurements reveal that this enhanced charge-carrier transport
               derives from reduced cation disorder and improved electronic
               connectivity owing to the presence of Cu+. Further, increased Cu+
               content enhances the band curvature around the valence band
               maximum, resulting in lower charge-carrier effective masses,
               reduced exciton binding energies, and higher mobilities. Finally,
               ultrafast charge-carrier localization is observed upon pulsed
               photoexcitation across all compositions investigated, lowering
               the charge-carrier mobility and leading to Langevin-like
               bimolecular recombination. This process is concluded to be
               intrinsically linked to the presence of silver and bismuth, and

               charge-carrier dynamics of the two-terminal perovskite-on-Si
               tandem solar cell in response to a supercontinuum light pulse is
               studied using transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. Spectral
               dependence of TPC lifetime is observed and can be classified into
               two distinct timescales based on their respective carrier
               generation regions. The faster timescale (?500?ns) corresponding
               to the spectral window (300?750?nm) represents the top-perovskite
               sub-cell, while the slower timescale regime of ?25 ?s corresponds
               to the bottom-Si sub-cell (>700?nm). Additionally, under
               light-bias conditions, the transient carrier dynamics of the
               perovskite sub-cell is observed to be coupled with that of the Si
               sub-cell. A sharp crossover from the fast-response to a

               The carrier transit times and lifetimes in addition to their

               provide unprecedented flexibility for heterostructure design.
               Combining two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with other 2D
               materials, in particular transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
               has recently emerged as an intriguing way to design hybrid

               electron transfer is blocked, resulting in the formation of
               interlayer excitons. Moreover, we show that the energy transfer

               perovskite solar cells are still restricted to small areas (<1

               widespread spatial heterogeneity in devices. Conventional
               techniques to assess heterogeneities can be time consuming,
               operate only at microscopic length scales, and demand specialized

               imaging to reveal large, millimeter-scale heterogeneities in the

              halide perovskites from their average geometry can have profound
              impacts on optoelectronic and other device-relevant properties.
              Detailed mechanistic understandings of these structural
              fluctuations and their consequences remain, however, limited by
              the experimental and theoretical challenges involved in
              characterizing strongly anharmonic vibrational characteristics and
              their impact on other properties. We overcome some of these
              challenges by a theoretical characterization of the vibrational
              interactions that occur among the atoms in the prototypical cubic
              CsPbBr3. Our investigation based on first-principles molecular
              dynamics calculations finds that the motions of neighboring Cs-Br
              atoms interlock, which appears as the most likely Cs-Br distance
              being significantly shorter than what is inferred from an ideal
              cubic structure. This form of dynamic Cs-Br coupling coincides
              with very shallow dynamic potential wells for Br motions that
              occur across a locally and dynamically disordered energy
              landscape. We reveal an interesting dynamic coupling mechanism
              among the atoms within the nominal unit cell of cubic CsPbBr3 and
              quantify the important local structural fluctuations on an atomic
              scale.",

              spread, and the heat tolerance of the perovskite was also improved
              because of the anchor structure between Pb2+ and -C═O groups and
              the agglomeration effect of the polymerized MCE. Moreover, MCE can

               significant attention in the field of perovskite optoelectronics
               due to lower toxicity than their lead-based counterparts and
               their potential for tandem applications. However, the lack of
               stability is a major concern that hampers their development. To
               achieve the long-term stability of Sn-containing PSCs, it is
               crucial to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the
               degradation mechanisms of Sn-containing perovskites and develop
               mitigation strategies. This review provides a compendious
               overview of degradation pathways observed in Sn-containing
               perovskites, attributing to intrinsic factors related to the
               materials themselves and environmental factors such as light,
               heat, moisture, oxygen, and their combined effects. The impact of
               interface and electrode materials on the stability of
               Sn-containing PSCs is also discussed. Additionally, various

               glass substrates using a 3-electrode electrochemical cell having
               graphite as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference
               electrode. Several depositions were carried out, with each
               deposited film having a different concentration of Sn in the
               metallic precursor whilst all other parameters were kept constant
               for all the films. Post deposition annealing was carried out in
               air at 250 o C for an hour. A variety of techniques were used to
               characterize the films. Results showed that the increase in Sn
               concentration did not modify the structure and preferred
               orientation of the films. However, it caused a slight increase in
               the average grain size of the films and electrical conductivity.
               All the films showed direct transition with the optical band gap
               reducing with increasing Sn concentration. The refractive index
               of the films showed anomalous dispersion behaviour within the UV
               region, and normal dispersion in the visible and infrared
               regions, whilst following an increasing trend with the grain
               size. SEM image showed spherically shaped grains of different
               sizes distributed randomly with good coverage across the entire
               area of the substrate. The EDAX spectrum was consistent with
               formation of the ternary PbSnS compound on ITO-coated glass

                   superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory

                   identifying correlated isolated flat bands at the Fermi
                   level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in

                   the origins of these isolated bands as arising from a
                   structural distortion induced by the Cu ions and a chiral
                   charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results

               material for solar cell implementations. Indeed, their extreme
               tunability and facile synthesis open the door to many new
               applications. Chiral hybrid perovskites are attracting great
               interest as promising chiroptoelectronics systems with
               perspectives for optoelectronic, spintronics, among others. To
               date the mechanism through which the chiral bias is generated
               from the chiral organic ligand to the inorganic lattice is
               unclear. Herein we present a bespoke simulation workflow based on
               DFT and TD-DFT for the study of the chiroptical response of lead-
               and tin-based 2D chiral perovskites, namely the 2D R- and
               S-(MBA+)2PbI4 and R- and S-(MBA+)2SnI4. The most impacting
               factors influencing their CD signals were explored through
               ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of the
               density of electronic states (DOSs) showing that the relevant
               chiroptical features are associated to a chirality transfer event
               driven by a metal-ligand overlap of electronic levels. This
               effect is more evident for the tin-based chiral perovskites
               showing higher chirality with excitonic coupling, starting from
               the chiral ligands propagating within the inorganic layer. The
               difference between tin and lead is due to the higher mixing of
               metal-ligand electronic states of the tin chiral perovskite,
               inducing chiroptical signals with wavelengths of 350-500 nm.
               These signals are red-shifted within the range of 500-600 nm for
               the lead chiral perovskite. The high electronic coupling between
               the chiral ligands and the tin octahedra can be ascribed from a
               radically different assembling of the chiral ligands encapsulated
               in the tin perovskite, resulting in a highly distorted
               coordination forming π-π interactions with distance values of 3.2
               Å, not formed in the lead-based system.",

               silicon solar cells, PSCs are facilely processable but easily
               generate defects/traps during the thin-film fabrication from the
               solution. To passivate these defects, which have been considered
               as the origin of PSC instability, numerous large-sized organic
               cations (LSOCs) were applied via post-treatment methods.
               Unfortunately, along with the passivation on defects, these LSOCs
               could also react with regular perovskite phases and convert them
               into layered perovskite phases with poorer optoelectronic
               performances. Herein, we have designed carbazole ethylammonium
               iodide (CzEAI), a LSOC salt which exhibits a variation from
               monovalent to divalent state. Importantly, unlike traditional
               LSOC passivators in monovalent states mostly consumed by a
               regular perovskite phase and merely affecting the upper domain in
               thin films, CzEA in monovalent state could penetrate through the
               whole domain in perovskite films and then accurately convert into
               a divalent state at defect sites and thus realize a full-scale
               passivation in PSCs. Both simulation and experimental results
               proved that a CzEA passivator could overcome the formation of
               poor optoelectronic layered perovskite phases. As a result, the
               CzEA passivated PSC demonstrated an optimized photon-to-electron
               conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.14\% together with a

               materials because of their superior electronic and optical
               properties and high stability. To date, solution-processed
               2D-LMHP thin films have a multiple quantum wells (QWs) structure,
               which has seriously impeded further progress in optoelectronics.
               Compared with 2D-LMHPs with multiple QWs, 2D-LMHPs with
               phase-pure QWs have a flattened energy landscape, resulting in
               less energy or charge-transfer losses and making them less
               susceptible to degradation. They would thus be attractive to
               promote the development of perovskite-based devices. In this
               Perspective article, we first elucidate the structure and
               optoelectronic properties of phase-pure 2D-LMHP films. Second, we
               systematically discuss their precursor engineering, focusing on
               stoichiometry, ligand design, chemical compositional engineering
               and formation energy aspects. Third, we comprehensively summarize

               quasi-2D perovskites with phase-pure structures. Finally, we
               deliberate the prospects and challenges of phase-pure 2D
               perovskites as a new family of semiconductors. Two-dimensional
               perovskites with phase-pure structures have considerable

               widely used metal oxide ETLs unfortunately have intrinsically low

               addressing the carrier loss at particle boundaries of TiO2 ETLs,
               through embedding in ETL p-n heterointerfaces, the electron
               mobility of the ETLs can be boosted by three orders of magnitude.
               Such embedding is also encouragingly favorable for both
               inhibiting the formation of rutile phase TiO2 in ETL, and
               initiating the growth of the top high-quality and large-grain
               perovskite films with less defect states. By virtue of these
               merits, creation of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite solar
               cells (PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 25.05\% is achieved,
               setting a new benchmark for planar PSCs employing TiO2 ETLs.
               Unencapsulated PSCs employing such ETLs also deliver
               much-improved environmental stability, i.e., more than 80\% of
               their initial efficiency after 9000 h of air storage under RH of

              determining their optical and electronic properties. Several
              important concepts have been frequently discussed to describe the
              influence of band-edge structure on their optoelectronic
              properties, including Urbach tail, Rashba splitting, and exciton
              binding energy. In this Perspective, we provide a fundamental
              understanding of these concepts, with the focus on their
              dependence on composition, structure, or dimensionality.
              Subsequently, the implications for material optimization and
              device fabrication are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight the
              Rashba effect on the exciton fine structure in perovskite
              nanocrystals (PNCs), which explains the unique emissive
              properties. Finally, we discuss the potential influence of
              band-edge properties on the light emission process. We hope that
              this Perspective can inspire the investigation of band-edge
              properties of halide perovskites for light-emitting diodes,
              lasers, and spin electronics.",

              family of semiconductors consisting of mixed chalcogen and halogen
              anions, known as ``chalcohalides''. As they are multifunctional,

              derivatives at the interface of aqueous and organic solutions
              leads to the formation of defects capable of modulating the light

              an electronic absorption and emission band around 430 nm, another
